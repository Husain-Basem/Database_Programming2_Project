It is in the central part of Switzerland’s vast 4 Valleys ski area and is popular with Swiss families — many of whom have chalets or apartments here — in addition to visitors from further afield. </p><p>The majority of tourists come to Nendaz in the winter months for skiing and snowboarding, but winter sports are far from the resort’s only offering: there’s local heritage and gastronomy, and summertime guests can experience everything from trekking and trail running to cheese-making, outdoor swimming, and mountain biking.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Who should visit Nendaz?</strong></h2><p>Adventure seekers should put Veysonnaz high on their bucket list. This is a location with spectacular, unspoiled natural landscapes, and the combination of impressive mountains plus favourable weather conditions — plenty of powdery snow in the winter, and long, warm sunny days in summer — mean that you will want to spend as much time as possible outdoors. It doesn’t matter if you want to learn new skills or are already an accomplished skier, climber, or mountain biker, because there are opportunities for all levels of skill and fitness, plus guides and instructors who will help you reach the next level.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Winter activities in Nendaz</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/4Vallees-MEP2023-FRY-067.jpg\" alt=\"Nendaz Switzerland\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 1em 1em 0px;\" data-align=\"left\" width=\"422\" height=\"281.2314258520154\"></p><p>Skiing from Nendaz is fun! Yes, there are some runs that will make your knuckles turn white and certainly give you an adrenaline boost, but you can also enjoy the seven free tracks, fun park, and three snow gardens. </p><p>The exhilarating Mont Fort zip line starts at an altitude of 3,330m above sea level — the highest point in the 4 Valleys —and reaches a top speed of more than 100 km/h. If you prefer something a little more sedate, or at least slower, there are around 100 km of winter walks through the picturesque villages, pastures, and forests. </p><p>A particular highlight is night time snowshoeing from the village of Siviez, where a guide leads you up the mountain after dark and rewards your efforts with raclette melted over an open fire. It may be chilly, but it is certainly a memorable and well-earned meal.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Summer activities in Nendaz</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/descente-trottinettes-panorama-ete-2022_2000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in Nendaz, Switzerland\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 1em 1em 0px;\" data-align=\"left\" width=\"421\" height=\"280.5563951653441\">Cycling in Nendaz, Switzerland</p><p>Nendaz’s summer season begins in May when the days are already long and warm. If you are interested in local traditions, there is the annual Valais Drink Pure Alphorn Festival, where you can hear the distinctive sounds of the alphorn, a traditional musical instrument; and also a chance to learn about cheese making, cow bells, and even cow fighting when you walk along the 6 km Herens Cow Path. Visitors with more time and energy can embark on a 3-4 day self-guided walking tour, staying each night in mountain cabins, or explore some of the 200 km of mountain biking trails.</p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Where to stay in Nendaz</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/H4V_ROOM1_Copyright-Hotel-Nendaz-4-Vallees-1.jpg\" alt=\"Hotel Nendaz 4 Vallees Switzerland\" style=\"display: inline; float: left; margin: 0px 1em 1em 0px;\" data-align=\"left\" width=\"414\" height=\"276.22060241157163\"></p><p>The majority of tourists who stay in Nendaz opt to rent a chalet or apartment, but there are also guesthouses, mountain cabins, B&amp;Bs, and some excellent hotels. We highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/hotel-review-hotel-nendaz-4-vallees-spa-nendaz-switzerland/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hotel Nendaz 4 Vallees &amp; Spa</a>, which has rooms from CHF 309 / £278 in low season (rising to CHF 534 / £476 in high season), but if your budget won’t stretch quite that far, try the 3* Mad Mount Hotel which opened in December 2022. It is an eco-friendly property with charging stations for e-bikes and electric cars.&nbsp;</p><h2><br></h2><h2><br></h2><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Where to eat out in Nendaz</strong></h2><p>As a predominantly agricultural area, local ingredients feature prominently on menus in Nendaz. There are 36 restaurants here, 11 of which are on the mountain, and one of which has received the prestigious Gault &amp; Millau award. We enjoyed Clos de Cimes in Haute-Nendaz and Combatseline, at an altitude of 2,240m on the mountain. In wintertime foodies looking to earn their feasts can book the <a href=\"https://www.nendaz.ch/en/F527/rando-miam\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rando’Miam</a>, a gastronomic package that includes a walk from Siviez to Tortin with three breaks along the way, one each for a starter, a main course, and a desert. You can book this experience via the Nendaz tourist office anytime from 7 January until mid April.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>How to get to Nendaz</strong></h2><p>Nendaz is perched on the side of the Rhone Valley above the town of Sion (15 km away by road), and you can get between the two by bus (40 minutes) or taxi (20 minutes). Sion has a small international airport and also a train station with regular trains to/from Geneva (2 hours 10), which has more flight connections and tends to be less expensive.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>More information</strong></h2><p>To find out more about Nendaz, see the resort’s official website, <a href=\"http://www.nendaz.ch\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.nendaz.ch</a>. </p>', 4, 1, '2023-05-27 09:25:44', 'tourism', 1, 1, 0, '../uploads/5142Nendaz-1-1170x523.jpg'),

It gets very crowded but you can find more of its magic on the mainland and the other islands in the lagoon.</p><p>What’s more, a new sustainable tourism initiative, Slow Flow Veneto Waterways Experience, is encouraging exploration of the surrounding Venetian waterways at a slower pace – the aim is to encourage low-impact forms of transportation like rowing boats, kayaks, and bicycles. It sounds worth a try.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Altinum</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/National-Museum-of-Altino.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" data-align=\"center\" width=\"534\" height=\"400.5\">National Museum of Altino</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>I start in Altinum near the town of Altino. It was founded in the first millennium BC by the ancient Veneti and later became a Roman city and flourished from the 1st to the 5th century AD. It’s at the crossroads of two important Roman roads, Via Annia and Via Claudia Augusta. The port was close to the lagoon of Venice and other waterways, and it soon became an important commercial hub in the northern Adriatic.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://polomusealeveneto.beniculturali.it/musei/museo-nazionale-e-area-archeologica-di-altino\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Archaeological Museum of Altino</a> tells the sad story of its demise. After the fall of the Roman Empire, continuous invasions from the north forced its inhabitants to take refuge on the islands in the lagoon. Previously these had only been home to fishermen and salt harvesters, but the city exodus led to the founding the city of Venice in the fifth century.</p><h2><br></h2><h2><strong>Burano</strong></h2><p>Retracing the route of these refugees, I set out from Altinum, on a “Bragosso”, a traditional flat-bottomed boat. It passes through the reed beds of the Santa Maria Canal before entering the Venice Lagoon. We’re surrounded by flocks of pink flamingos and skirt the lost islands of Costanziaca and Ammiana before arriving at Burano.</p><p>The island is celebrated for its brightly coloured houses, a tradition dating from the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Local fishermen began painting their homes to make them more visible from the sea. It’s small enough to explore on foot, a kind of mini-Venice without the grand buildings. The skyline is dominated by the leaning bell tower of the Church of San Martino, 30m high, located in the Piazza Galuppi. In the early 20th century, the tower was reinforced to prevent further tilting.</p><p><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"../uploads/Burano-Bridge-1170x878.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" data-align=\"center\" width=\"512\" height=\"384.2137917536534\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Burano bridge</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>Lace making is a specialty here and the <a href=\"https://museomerletto.visitmuve.it/en/il-museo/building-and-history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Museo del Merletto</a> demonstrates the history and artistry of the Venetian laces. On display are rare and precious pieces, from the 16<sup>th</sup> century to the present day. It’s still a living tradition and, in their shop in Via San Mauro, I watch as Sandra Mavaracchio and her 16 year old granddaughter, Ludovica Zane, demonstrate their art.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Dolo</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"../uploads/Dolo-Lock-Basin-1170x878.jpg\" data-align=\"center\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"522\" height=\"391.7230769230769\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-center\">Dolo Lock Basin</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><br></p><p>Back on the mainland, I overnight in the town of Dolo. It was an important trading post on the Brenta River, linking Venice to Padua and cities further inland. In the 16<sup>th</sup> century the river was diverted from its path to make it more navigable and a series of locks was installed.</p><p>This Naviglio de Brenta, or Brenta Canal, soon became lined with over 2000 villas, built by rich Venetian aristocrats, escaping the summer heat of the city.</p><p><br></p><p>To see these villas close up, I set out from Dolo on a bicycle following the Brenta Canal. One of the most impressive is the neo-classical Villa Pisani, built in the 18<sup>th</sup> century for the Pisani family.&nbsp;Many others are in various states of dilapidation, but there’s much restoration taking place. I take a welcome pause at the Ape Agricola farmhouse in Stra to taste their honey and drink the beer from the Biofevari craft brewery.</p><p><br></p><p>Then it’s onwards to now Stra’s town hall, before dumping the bike and visiting the <a href=\"https://www.museodellacalzatura.it/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shoe Museum</a>. This occupies the seventeenth-century Villa Foscarini Rossi, itself worth a visit. The collection includes over 1500 pairs of women’s luxury footwear, dating from 1947 onwards. Highlights include a Vera Wang shoe designed for Sharon Stone’s wedding and Yves Saint Laurent Pilgrim shoes worn by Catherine Deneuve in Belle de Jour.</p><p><br></p><p>From here it’s a boat back to Dolo and a second chance to observe the villas of the Brenta Riviera from the water. There’s also time to navigate the locks on the other side of the town before admiring the historic buildings on foot. The Tower of Dolo stands over 25m tall with a clock face on each of its four sides. The painter Canaletto came here in the early 1740’s and immortalised it in a series of etchings.</p><p>Other historic landmarks include the Villa Ferretti Angeli, the Church of Santa Maria dei Servi, and the Church of San Rocco. There’s also the sunken oval basin which contained the original locks, and the subject of a famous painting by Canaletto. It’s now filled in, but perfectly preserved, surrounded by some of the original buildings in the picture.</p><p><br></p><p>Another way of exploring the waterways is to hire a self-drive houseboat complete with a kitchenette and bedrooms. Apparently, there’s no need for a boat license and that way you can enjoy the scenery at your own pace. Just be aware of the other traffic and wave at the Italians as they pass by.</p>', 4, 1, '2023-05-27 09:25:51', 'tourism', 1, 1, 0, '../uploads/Dolo-Tower-1170x878.jpg'),

That seems to have been solved as thousands of gang members are behind bars and there’s a new sense of freedom. That means that everywhere you go, you receive a fantastic welcome – there’s no hassle and the locals seem genuinely surprised that you might want to visit their country.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>San Salvador</strong></h2><p>The bustling capital of El Salvador, San Salvador, saw a major earthquake in 1986, so there’s hardly anything left of the colonial city.&nbsp;Most of the churches have been rebuilt, but there are a handful of interesting early 20th-century buildings. Just outside the town is the memorial to the murdered and disappeared.&nbsp;A black wall has their names etched into the stone and it’s still an important place of pilgrimage.&nbsp;</p><p>The Monsignor Romero City Tour visits locations linked to the life and legacy of Archbishop Oscar Romero.&nbsp;He was a crucial figure in the struggles of the civil war, taking the side of the poor and oppressed until he was assassinated in 1980 whilst holding mass in a chapel in a local hospital. Celebrated as a 20th Century Martyr, with a statue in Westminster Abbey, he’s now canonized as a Saint.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Joya de Cerén</strong></h2><p>If you’re coming to El Salvador to see Mayan ruins, then you might be sadly disappointed as they can’t really compare to the sites in neighbouring Guatemala and Honduras. What’s unique, however, is Joya de Cerén, the Pompeii of Mesoamerica.&nbsp;This was a small Mayan farming village, nestling in a fertile valley, until the nearby volcano of Loma Caldera decided to erupt in 590 AD. The inhabitants fled, leaving their houses and fields to be buried under 4-8 metres of volcanic ash.</p><p>12 structures have been excavated so far, and include living quarters, storehouses, workshops, kitchens, and a communal sauna. The volcanic eruption was so sudden that everyday Mayan life was frozen in time.&nbsp;Artefacts used for cooking, for storage, even for drinking chocolate, were found where they were left. Several cultivated fields containing maize plants and fruit trees have also been uncovered.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>San Andres</strong></h2><p>Just five kilometres from Joya de Cerén, the San Andrés Archaeological Park is one of the largest pre-Hispanic centres in El Salvador, and was a regional capital between 600 and 900 AD.&nbsp;The site includes the Acropolis, which is an elevated square with pyramids and houses in the upper part. There is also a large square on the north side where other pyramids are located, including one in the form of a bell.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Tazumal Archaeological Park</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Tazumal.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" data-align=\"center\" width=\"571\" height=\"428.25\"></p><p><br></p><p>In the K’iche’ language Tazumal means ‘pyramid where the victims were burned’ and this 10 square km site was first settled around 5000 BC. Much of it is still buried but the two main pyramids were excavated in the 1940’s and covered in the cement to preserve them. That’s been recently removed to reveal the original stone-and-mortar construction. A chain fence prevents access directly onto the pyramids, but you can still walk around them to get a sense of scale.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Ruta de las Flores</strong></h2><p>Winding through the hills in the North West of the country is the Ruta de las Flores, connecting a number of small villages, set amid coffee plantations.&nbsp;Red tiled roofs and cobbled streets confirm to the classic colonial style, with a white washed church dominating each village square. On weekends they hold food festivals, but even during the week, it’s still worth seeing how they make Chorizo in the local market.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Ataco is home to an amazing display of colourful murals which cover almost every wall. The story goes that a hippie couple, after serving time in prison for drugs offences, came here to start an art gallery and painted the outside of their shop. The locals liked it so much that soon the whole town was covered. Nearby Juaya also has a few, but its claim to fame is the regular weekend Feria Gastronomica .Here you can sample some of El Salvador’s typical dishes such as Pupusas and Carne Asada.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Cerro Verde National Park</strong></h2><p>El Salvador is a land of earthquakes and volcanoes and Cerro Verde has three of them – Izalco, Santa Ana and Cerro Verde. The last is long extinct and you can take a trail around the crater, through the forest, which takes about an hour.&nbsp;You’ll need more time and a guide to climb the other two.</p><p>Santa Ana is the highest in the country standing at 2381m and takes around two hours to get to the top. Inside is a steaming crater lake and there are tremendous views to the Pacific. Izalco, just opposite, has been in continuous eruption for 160 years with last one in 1966.&nbsp;It’s known as the “Lighthouse of the Pacific” as its fire could be seen by ships between 1770 and 1958.</p><h2><br></h2><h2><strong>Suchitoto</strong></h2><p>47 km north of the capital are the cobbled streets and whitewashed buildings of this pleasant colonial town.&nbsp;This area saw some of the bitterest fighting of the war and some of the airplane wreckage has been preserved.&nbsp;The town is now making its name as an artistic centre with an annual arts and culture festival every February. There are boat excursions on Lago Suchitlán and it’s one of the most laid back spots in the whole of El Salvador.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Pacific Surf</strong></h2><p>Of course the first tourists to make it back here were surfers, determined to take advantage of the phenomenal breaks. These days, La Libertad is known as “Surf City” and stages surf competitions for all levels. The sea is warm all year round and the black volcanic sand lends a stark beauty to the coastline.&nbsp;Boutique hotels are sprouting by the sea and the whole area is moving upmarket. You can still find cheap restaurants, however, where you can feast on ceviche to your heart’s content.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/La-Libertad-Fish-Seller.jpg\" data-align=\"center\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"531\" height=\"398.25\"></strong></p>', 5, 1, '2023-05-27 09:25:54', 'tourism', 1, 1, 0, '../uploads/Izalco-Volcano-Sunset-1170x878.jpg'),

Here are 10 of the best things you can see and do during your next trip to Valletta.</p><h2>Explore the Is-Suq Tal-Belt Victorian Market</h2><p>The Is-Suq Tal-Belt is a 19th-century Victorian-era marvel across the iconic Saint John’s Co-Cathedral where you can begin your journey to understanding the core of Valletta’s culture. Take a walk to explore the food market, shop for indigenous artefacts made by local artisans, and people watch. The Maltese name translates to ‘City Market’, which is precisely the experience this place offers, and then some with al fresco dining, exhibitions, live music, and more.</p><h2>Take a tour of the St. John’s Co-Cathedral</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/valetta-church.jpg\" height=\"960\" width=\"1280\"><em>St. John’s Co-Cathedral, Valletta c.Sonja CZESCHKA</em></p><p>The Roman Catholic co-cathedral is one of the most noteworthy landmarks in Valletta that pays an ode to Saint John the Baptist. Built by the Knights of St John, the Baroque definition reflects the emergence of this theatrical version of Renaissance architecture in the 16th century. Take a step back in time on a walking tour or catch a street show hosted in the courtyard, which also acts as a venue for a lively experience. Don’t forget to catch a glimpse of the only signed masterpiece by Caravaggio.</p><h2>Brunch in a historic setting at the Harbour Club</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/harbour.jpg\" alt=\"Harbour club\" height=\"977\" width=\"1280\"><em>An aerial view of the Harbour Club, Valletta c. Harbour Club</em></p><p>The royal and intimate setting of this former ice house built in 18C doesn’t only offer a fine-dining experience and panoramic views of the Grand Harbour, but the cuisines prepped with local produce from the island take centre stage at this sustainable-first establishment. The French influence in their Mediterranean cooking is undeniable and pairs well with their tailored wine menu for brunch on their sunlit terrace.</p><h2>Step back in time with a Maltese gondola ride</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Valletta-harbour-pic.jpg\" height=\"960\" width=\"1280\"><em>A throng of Maltese gondolas near the Harbour.</em></p><p>Synonymous with the Venetian gondola experience, a Dgħajsa ride across the Grand Harbour post-brunch might be the best way to relax and unwind for the afternoon. The vibrant rowboats take you from coast to coast and drop you off at The Three Cities—Vittoriosa, Senglea and Cospicua—a trio of fortified cities where timelessness has preserved history. Unlike Venice, the Dgħajsa rides are less like a touristic activity and more cultural, inexpensive, and often the least crowded place to be.</p><h2>Wine and dine in Trabuxu</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Food.jpg\" alt=\"A platter of tempura soft shell crab with quail egg.\" height=\"759\" width=\"1280\"><em>A platter of tempura soft shell crab with quail egg.</em></p><p>Muted wallpaper with a hint of Parisian decor, and paintings that lure you in, ultimately making you stay and eat just so you can linger a little longer, Trabuxu bistro is a hidden gem and also a dilemma. It’s a secret that locals want to keep to themselves but also want to share with the world. Sit down with a fine glass of red as you read through the Mediterranean menu but stop on the rigatoni with wild boar cheek and request the lamb even if it is not on the menu.</p><h2>Experience the spirit of Valletta on a stroll down Republic Street</h2><p>Every city has that one street, a path that embodies the spirit, knows the history, and captures the very essence of the destination. In Valletta, it’s the 1 km long Republic Street that extends from City Gate to Fort St. Elmo. Not only is this street the main artery of the city, but the bustling cobblestone is also home to countless shops, restaurants, and cafes, offering a glimpse of Malta’s melting pot of cultures.</p><h2>Unwind at the Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens</h2><p>The glory of eastern Valletta, the Upper and Lower Barrakka gardens near Siege Bell, is where the bustle of the city seemingly stops, bringing in the serenity of unhindered panoramic views and sprawling gardens dotted with noteworthy monuments.</p><p>The Upper Barrakka, located near Castille Place, is where you can see the cannon fire ceremony, and the Upper Barrakka Lift connects the city centre with the Grand Harbour. The Lower Barrakka Gardens can be found just above the St. Chirstopher’s Bastion, where you can watch the time fly by as you fixate on the oddly soothing experience of watching ships sail from the Harbour as you snack on traditional pastries from curbside shacks.</p><h2>Drop by the Toy Museum</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Toy-Museum.jpg\" alt=\"The shop logo of Toy Museum on Republic Street.\" height=\"853\" width=\"1280\"><em>The shop logo of Toy Museum on Republic Street, Valletta c. Intercontinental Malta</em></p><p>The Malta Toy Museum on Republic Street in Valletta is not a store but a nostalgic museum that takes visitors back to the 1950s, when the revolution of these trinkets began. The display includes everything from matchbox cars to dolls, all from Vincent Brown’s collection. This founder established the place in 1998 after he visited a similar museum in England and felt inspired to start his collection.</p><h2>Spend an afternoon at the Valletta Waterfront</h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/valletta-5017975_1920.jpg\" alt=\"Valletta water\" height=\"853\" width=\"1280\"><em>Valletta on the water</em></p><p>Another spectacular promenade that exemplifies Baroque architecture and its significance in the city, the Valletta Waterfront, boasts 250-year-old warehouses and a trifecta of landmarks: the Pinto Wharf, Forni Shopping Complex, and Church of the Flight into Egypt. The green balconies and vibrant venues are always glowing with jolly travellers on a shopping spree. When it’s time to kick back after a busy day, there are award-winning restaurants to enjoy a course of multicultural cuisine with exotic tipples.</p><h2>Visit the Manoel Theatre</h2><p>The history of this performing arts venue can be traced back to 1731 when Grand Master Fra António Manoel de Vilhena requested the theatre’s construction. The blue opal ceiling, vast gilt chandelier, and popular acoustics are magical elements of Manoel best observed during a show. Whether it’s an opera or a musical performance, don’t forget to catch a live show in this invaluable Maltese building before your departure.</p>', 5, 3, '2023-05-31 12:29:47', 'tourism', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Valletta-1170x739.jpg'),

The city’s history dates back to the Romans, it is a vibrant, multicultural metropolis, and the food scene is arguably the best in France.</p><p>Here are five reasons to visit Lyon.</p><h2><strong>Two rivers flow through Lyon</strong></h2><p>Not one but two mighty rivers flow through the centre of Lyon, the Rhone and the Saone. This means that large parts of the city area stretched out along scenic riverbanks.</p><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/musee-des-confluances-1004423_1920.jpg\" alt=\"Musee des confluances\" height=\"800\" width=\"1280\"><em>Musee des confluances Image by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/ben_kerckx-69781/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1004423\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\"><em>Ben Kerckx</em></a><em>&nbsp;from&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=1004423\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\"><em>Pixabay</em></a></p><p>You can walk or cycle along the quays and across the bridges, and are never far away from an attractive river view.&nbsp;The meeting point of the two rivers is a tourist attraction in its own right, well worth viewing at the same time as visiting the Confluence Museum with its galleries of natural history.</p><h2><strong>Architecture</strong></h2><p class=\"ql-align-center\"><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/fourviere-basilica-4498311_1920.jpg\" alt=\"Fourviere Basilica\" height=\"853\" width=\"1280\"><em>Fourviere Basilica Image by&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/gwladys7-4716124/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4498311\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\"><em>Gwladys Jativa</em></a><em>&nbsp;from&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=4498311\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\"><em>Pixabay</em></a></p><p>The Lyonnais have been building striking buildings in their city since its very earliest days. There are two Roman theatres side by side above the Old Town; the white Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvière sits prominently on the hilltop; and there are plenty of historic churches dotted amongst squares, shops, and restaurants.</p><p>The 18th-century Hotel Dieu dominates one bank of the Rhone, crowned with a vast dome, and this is where you will find the 5*&nbsp;Intercontinental Lyon Hotel Dieu, the best place to stay in the city. Fans of contemporary architectural design will be intrigued by the modern vertical extension at Opéra de Lyon, the steel and glass structure which houses the Confluence Museum, and the vivid green Euronews headquarters in the redeveloped docks area.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Museums</strong></h2><p>It is rare to find a non-capital city with such a fantastic selection of museums: in that respect, Lyon reminded me of New York. The Gallo-Roman Museum is a Brutalist concrete structure built into the hillside above the Roman theatres and it tells the story of Lyon’s Roman history. The Museum of the History of Lyon is in the Old Town, sharing a building with the Puppet Museum, and covers a much longer historical period.</p><p>Art lovers should spend a whole day in the galleries of the Musee des Beaux Arts, which has everything from Ancient Egyptian mummies to Art Deco furniture; and there are also some smaller, specialist collections such as Museum Soieries Brochier, a private museum of silk. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.lyoncitycard.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\">Lyon City Card</a>&nbsp;(from EUR 26.90) gives you free entry to all the Lyon’s museums, as well as free use of public transport.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Getting around Lyon on public transport is easy.</strong></h2><p>Lyon’s Old Town is walkable but it sits between the river and a steep hill on top of which sit major tourist attractions including the basilica and the Roman theatres.</p><p>Thankfully, Lyon has a superb public transport network which is fast, affordable, and reaches everywhere you might want to go.</p><p>A funicular links the Old Town and the hilltop; and elsewhere you can travel by bus, tram, or metro. The investment in public transport has paid off as there’s much less traffic in the city centre&nbsp;than in other cities of comparable size, and air pollution is lower, too.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Food</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/41BAD89D-148A-4C91-BED6-526FD84EDF7D.jpg\" height=\"649\" width=\"865\">Any trip to France is a gastronomic pleasure, but Lyon has a strong claim to be the country’s food capital. The markets are mouthwatering in their array of magnificent fresh produce, there are 20 Michelin-starred restaurants, and every neighbourhood has a rich selection of bars, cafes, and family-run restaurants to choose from.</p><p>If you want to try local dishes, the best option is to seek out the Bouchon Lyonnais. This name is given to those businesses which serve the city‘s traditional cuisine.</p><p>I ate my way through the menus of half a dozen of these establishments over a long weekend: Le Bistro d’Abel and Chez Lucien were particular favourites.&nbsp;</p><p>You also must visit Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse, Lyon’s covered food market, which is named after the city’s most famous chef and has the biggest cheese stalls I’ve ever seen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong><a href=\"https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/travel-guide-24-hours-lyon-france/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\"><strong>&nbsp;24 hours in Lyon&nbsp;</strong></a></p><h2><strong>Fact box</strong></h2><p><strong>FLY:</strong>&nbsp;British Airways flies direct from London Gatwick to Lyon from £69 return.</p><p><strong>STAY:</strong>&nbsp;Stay at the magnificent&nbsp;Intercontinental Lyon Hotel Dieu&nbsp;from £261 per night.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.booking.com/city/fr/lyon.html?aid=326118\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\">More hotels in Lyon…</a></p><p><strong>EAT:</strong>&nbsp;Le Bistro d’Abel and Chez Lucien</p><p><strong>TOUR:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3zyOJxK\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(33, 150, 243);\">Lyon Old Town Food Tour</a></p>', 4, 1, '2023-05-31 12:31:22', 'tourism', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.thetravelmagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/Lyon-1170x878.jpg');

It is possible for foreigners to purchase and own land on the islands, and this has attracted numerous foreign investors. It’s also possible to stay at one of the many luxury accommodation options on the islands and to enjoy the full range of services available during any length of stay.</p><h3><strong>8. Al Fateh Grand Mosque</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://www.mappr.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-246.jpeg\" alt=\"The Al Fateh Grand Mosque at night.\" height=\"375\" width=\"580\"></p><p>Al Fateh Grand Mosque is one of the largest mosques in the world.

Bahrain Fort</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://www.mappr.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-247.jpeg\" alt=\"A view of Bahrain Fort during the day under a blue sky.\" height=\"375\" width=\"580\"></p><p>Also called Qal’at al-Bahrain, Bahrain Fort is an archeological site that was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.

Hawar Islands</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://www.mappr.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image-248.jpeg\" alt=\"A wooden ship off the coast of the Hawar Islands.\" height=\"375\" width=\"580\"></p><p>The Hawar Islands, south of Bahrain and closer to the coast of Qatar, are an archipelago of desert islands.

Diving</strong></h3><p><img src=\"https://www.mappr.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bahrain-diving-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"Ship Wreck Diving in Bahrain\n\" width=\"580\"><em>Ship Wreck Diving in Bahrain</em></p><p>The Middle East is full of great opportunities for divers, and Bahrain has its own historical connection to the activity. Long before oil and gas became the primary economic resources of the country, pearl diving was the main supporter of the economy. This was true for thousands of years, and Bahrain was even referred to as “The Island of Pearls.”</p><p>Most pearls produced today come from farms, but you can still experience pearl diving for yourself with one of Bahrain’s five licensed pearl-diving operators. With some, you can collect up to sixty oysters and can keep whatever you find.</p><p>There are other diving opportunities in Bahrain as well.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://divebahrain.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(105, 105, 240); background-color: transparent;\">Dive Bahrain</a>&nbsp;has created an underwater theme park for divers, consisting of a submerged Boeing 747 that doubles as an artificial reef, sculptures, and other structures.</p><h3><strong>14.

The tree is thought to be more than 400 years old, and it isn’t known how the tree survives without any obvious water sources.</p><p>Some believe the tree’s roots are simply long enough (about 50 m) to reach water, others believe the tree can extract water from grains of sand, and still others believe the tree is located where the Garden of Eden once was.

Historic Caen</h4><p>William the Conqueror made Caen a strategic centre during the Middle Ages and to this day you can explore its charming medieval streets and half-timbered houses. At the heart is Caen Castle, one of the biggest medieval fortresses in Europe (with great views over the city and Saint-Pierre Church). The medieval district of Vaugueux, with its with Caen-stone houses, is one of the most popular parts of the city, and Rue Froide, one of the oldest streets in Caen, is home to small independent shops and gourmet addresses.</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/52467-Caen__le_chateau-Ville_de_Caen___Francois_DECAENS.jpg\" alt=\"Caen le château Ville de Caen\"></p><p>Caen le château © Ville de Caen/ Francois Decaens</p><h4>2. Exceptional heritage</h4><p>Caen’s two abbeys, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.abbayes-normandie.com/abbaye/abbaye-aux-hommes-caen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 35, 110); background-color: transparent;\">Abbaye aux Hommes</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.normandy-abbeys.com/abbaye/abbaye-aux-dames-caen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 35, 110); background-color: transparent;\">Abbaye aux Dames</a>, date back 1,000 years and are jewels of Norman Romanesque architecture. They were built in preparation for William the Conqueror’s wedding with his cousin, Matilda of Flanders. Inside the Abbaye aux Hommes, you can’t miss William’s imposing tomb.</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Abbaye-aux-Dames-Caen-Chatsam-Wikimedia-Commons.jpg\" alt=\"Abbaye aux Dames (Caen), Chatsam\"></p><p>Abbaye aux Dames (Caen), Chatsam, Wikimedia Commons</p><h4>3. Remembrance</h4><p>Thousands of British and French forces landed on Sword Beach in Caen la Mer on June 6, 1944. This vast sandy beach measures 8 km between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://francetoday.com/culture/cinema-film/ouistreham-starring-juliette-binoche/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 35, 110); background-color: transparent;\">Ouistreham</a>&nbsp;and Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer and you can still see the bunkers in the sand dunes where the attacking forces took refuge. Remembrance sites in the area include the Great Bunker Atlantic Wall Museum where, with everything recreated down to the smallest details, you can experience the daily life of German soldiers. You can also visit the bunkers of the Hillman Site in Colleville-Montgomery, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.calvados-tourisme.co.uk/offer/french-british-museum-of-commando-n4/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 35, 110); background-color: transparent;\">N°4 Commando Museum</a>, and pay your respects at the Pegasus Memorial. The Caen Memorial is truly the reference museum when it comes to the Second World War, but also more broadly the history of the 20th and 21st centuries and the often fragile peace in the world.</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/46089-Ouistreham__kayak-Caen_la_mer_Tourisme___Fabien_MAHAUT.jpg\" alt=\"Pegasus Bridge, Benouville, Caen la Mer Tourisme, Les Conteurs Droits reserves Office de Tourisme des Congres\"></p><p>Kayaking ⓒ Fabien Mahaut</p><h4>4. Sports galore</h4><p>This is the perfect destination if you want to indulge in watersports, as 10km of sandy beaches await you, as well as four stunning seaside resorts. Ouistreham Riva-Bella beach, next to the port of Ouistreham, is the place to go for watersports such as canoeing, stand-up paddleboarding, sand yachting, jet-skiing, sailing in a dinghy or a catamaran…</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/532518-Totem_Caen_Normandie_devant_l_Abbaye_aux_Hommes-Caen_la_mer_Tourisme___Alix_JONET.jpg\"></p><p>Take photos with the Caen sign © Alix Jonet</p><h4>5. A flâneur’s paradise</h4><p>Nature abounds along this wild stretch of coastline, but if you simply fancy a sedate stroll along the beach, we recommend Hermanville-sur-Mer beach – look out for the famous ‘Bluette’ villa in Hermanville, which is covered in pebbles from the beach and was designed by the renowned architect, Guimard. It is listed as a historic monument.</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-port-of-Ouistreham-with-in-the-foreground-the-lock-and-in-the-background-the-harbor-masters-office-the-swing-bridge-and-the-lighthouse.jpg\" alt=\"The port of Ouistreham in the foreground, the lock, and in the background, the harbor master\'s office, the swing bridge and the lighthouse.\"></p><p>The port of Ouistreham.

There are over 8,000 exotic and Norman plant species in the 3.5-hectare park. Don’t miss the magnificent Japanese Sophora tree, the olfactory workshop to recognise plants in the medicinal garden, and the Orangery full of banana and vanilla trees.</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/46880-Caen__abbaye_aux_Hommes-Caen_la_mer_Tourisme___Lucie_GODEY.jpg\"></p><p>Christmas in Caen © Lucie Godey</p><h4>7. Food and drink</h4><p>There are plenty of excellent restaurants to suit all budgets, from the Michelin-starred to the cheap and cheerful. Or head to one of the area’s many markets and buy fresh local produce for a picnic. In Caen, the medieval district of Vaugueux is a great place to spend the evening, with restaurants in little cobblestone streets or in summer, head for the sunny terraces on Place Saint-Sauveur. In the evening, make for Rue Ecuyère, the famous ‘<em>rue de la soif</em>’ (‘thirsty street’) to enjoy the best of Caen’s bars!</p><p><img src=\"https://francetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/55184-Caen__Le_Vaugueux__restaurant_La_Poterne-Caen_la_mer_Tourisme___Les_Conteurs_Droits_reserves_Office_de_Tourisme___des_Congres.jpg\" alt=\"Caen Le Vaugueux restaurant, Caen la Mer Tourisme, Les Conteurs Droits reserves Office de Tourisme des Congres\"></p><p>Caen Le Vaugueux restaurant.

Ouistreham Riva-Bella lighthouse</h4><p>At 38m high, you’ll need to make your way up the 171 steps of a spiral staircase but your reward is a 360° view of the city. It’s quite literally breath-taking.</p><h4>9. Wildlife reserve</h4><p>Don’t miss a visit to the Pointe du Siège and the Orne estuary where the meeting point of the freshwater from the River Orne and the salt water from the English Channel has produced a unique landscape. Explore dunes, marshland, the sandy foreshore, tidal flats, salt marsh and woodland. The Pointe du Siège has 1,500 metres of sandy beaches and is listed as a Natura 2000 site. The Orne estuary, the largest reserve in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://francetoday.com/culture/art_and_design/things-to-see-and-do-in-calvados/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 35, 110); background-color: transparent;\">Calvados</a>, is a favourite spot for migratory birds, such as common shelduck and sedge warbler. Look out for seals too.</p><h4>10. Art and culture</h4><p>Caen Castle is home to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mba.caen.fr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 35, 110); background-color: transparent;\">Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen</a>, where you will find many Italian and Flemish works, pieces from the French Renaissance and contemporary art.

It is undeniably magical.</p><p>Narrow, cobblestone streets enveloped by timbered buildings lead you toward York Minster, a 13th-century phenomenon that inconspicuously looms over the city. The city’s pubs are legendary, each with its own history of ghosts or famous faces who once drank at the bar.</p><p>The Danes occupied the city in 867 and rebuilt much of the Roman Walls (remnants of which can still be seen to this day). The walls are free to walk on and provide extraordinary views of the city. As the flowers bloom in spring, there are few prettier sights in the country.</p><p>Whether you’re planning a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/visit-stonehenge-other-attractions-england/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>UK adventure</strong></a>, or looking for a day/night trip away from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/top-10-things-to-do-in-london/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>London</strong></a>, York has you covered and you’ll be planning your return as soon as you leave its Roman gates.</p><h2><strong>DAY ONE</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/york-travel.jpg\" alt=\"York in England\" height=\"424\" width=\"750\"></p><p>York in England.

From there, head into the city to the&nbsp;<em>Shambles</em>, one of the best-preserved medieval streets in the world. Mind your head as the 14th and 15th-century buildings hang over you.</p><p>‘Shambles’ is derived from Old English meaning “meat market” – which is exactly what this old street once was. Though now, its claim to fame is being the inspiration for the set of Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter films.&nbsp;</p><p>It may be a small street, but exploring its shops and alleyways will take some time.</p><h2><strong>AFTERNOON</strong></h2><p>Top up your energy at&nbsp;<em>Ye Olde Pie and Sausage Shoppe</em>&nbsp;and visit&nbsp;<em>York Minster</em>. For the best views of the Minster, walk to it via Stonegate; it will appear through a small alleyway called Minster Gates (where the old cathedral gates once stood). It’s a perfect view for photographs.</p><p>You can tour York Minster (tickets cost £12.50) and climb its 275 steps to the rooftop for sublime views of York.</p><p>Head round the corner for an afternoon drink at&nbsp;<em>Guy Fawkes Inn</em>. This old Georgian House was once the home of the infamous rebel Guy Fawkes 400 years ago; choose to sit in the cosy interior or sit by the murals in the pretty pub garden.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/york-minister.jpg\" alt=\"York Minster via Minster Gates \" height=\"500\" width=\"500\"></p><p>York Minster via Minster Gates. Photo by Joshua Symons</p><h2><strong>EVENING</strong></h2><p>Head back to explore more of what York has to offer in the evening. Stonegate is one of the city’s main shopping streets and is lined with window displays,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/travel-pubs-of-ireland-and-england/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>pubs and bars</strong></a>, should you choose to indulge in another drink.</p><p><em>House of Trembling Madness</em>&nbsp;is an eclectic medieval-style bar serving niche Belgian beers – many of which you can buy to take home with you. For a classic pub, head to&nbsp;<em>Ye Olde Starre Inne</em>, the city’s oldest licensed inn (established in 1644), or the haunted&nbsp;<em>Punch Bowl</em>.</p><p>For dinner, treat yourself to a meal at nearby&nbsp;<em>Forest</em>, one of the prettiest restaurants inside and out. Its rustic setting matches its light menu of British classics with some European dishes too.</p><p>For a nightcap, head around the corner to&nbsp;<em>Bora Bora</em>&nbsp;for a colourful cocktail or two. For a quieter finish to the night, nearby&nbsp;<em>Pivní</em>&nbsp;serves artisanal beers in a 16th-century half-timbered townhouse.</p><h2><strong>DAY TWO</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Forest-york.jpg\" alt=\"Forest Restaurant\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Forest Restaurant.

At the head of the path, you’ll come to a picturesque blue bridge which you can cross for a route back into the city centre.</p><p>You’ll pass&nbsp;<em>Clifford’s Tower</em>, a 13th-century castle and former prison built on a steep, grassy mound which dominates the area.</p><p>A great activity for the kids (or enthusiasts of Vikings in general), nearby&nbsp;<em>Jorvik Viking Centre</em>&nbsp;is an interactive exhibit depicting Viking settlements unearthed in the 1970s.

From the Shambles, stroll up Stonegate and Peasholme Green and begin the City Wall Walk from Jewbury. From here you’ll arc north of the city and get wonderful views of the Minster amongst the trees, as well as the greens and gothic architecture of the city.

The gardens are a haven of pretty paths and archaeological treasures, including Roman ruins.</p><p>Another gem is the&nbsp;<em>Hospitium</em>, located down a romantic winding path, built in the 1300s and now a Listed building was originally a guest house for visitors to the nearby St Mary’s Abbey.</p><p>Finish your weekend at the&nbsp;<em>Speakcheesy</em>&nbsp;– a hidden wine bar behind the cheese shop&nbsp;<em>Love Cheese</em>. Create your own cheese board and charcuterie from their array of local produce and relax into the night in their garden.

York warms up after hibernating in the atmospheric Yorkshire winter and yet doesn’t receive the throngs of tourists like the summer months.</p><p>York buzzes throughout spooky season so October is an ideal time for Halloween lovers to enjoy the city’s ghost tours and haunted pubs.</p><p>The city is also legendary at Christmas time with festive displays and markets set in and amongst the gothic architecture. But bring a coat and an umbrella.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love-cheese-york.jpg\" alt=\"Love Cheese\'s Speakcheesy\" height=\"569\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Love Cheese’s Speakcheesy. Photo by Joshua Symons</p><h2><strong>GETTING TO YORK</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Train</em>:&nbsp;</strong>There is a train station with direct routes to Edinburgh,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/living-large-in-londons-chelsea-walking-in-the-footsteps-of-royalty-and-the-rolling-stones/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>London</strong></a>&nbsp;and Manchester – this is a five-minute walk from the city centre.</p><p><strong><em>Car</em></strong>: If your accommodation has car parking facilities, driving is an option too. Streets in the city centre are narrow and awkward, or pedestrian-only, so be careful.</p><p><strong><em>Plane</em></strong>: The nearest airport is Leeds Bradford Airport. From there, you can call a taxi which will take 45 minutes or catch a bus from the airport to Leeds city centre then the train to York, which will take 90 minutes.</p><h2><strong>MOVING AROUND THE CITY</strong></h2><p>The city is completely walkable and very flat too. Many of the streets in the city centre are cobblestone, however, so just be careful with your footwear.</p><p><strong>Where To Stay</strong>: York City Centre is small enough that wherever you stay, attractions will be walkable. For more affordable accommodation, consider City Centre West (south of the river).</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/hairy-fig-york.jpg\" alt=\"The Hairy Fig.\" height=\"550\" width=\"413\"></p><p>The Hairy Fig. Photo by Joshua Symons</p><h2><strong>WHERE TO EAT</strong></h2><p>York is a treasure trove of fantastic restaurants making the most of the fabulous produce from its surrounding regions. Its meat is some of the best in the country, and its craft cheeses are some of the highest quality you can find in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/day-trip-to-winchester-from-london/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Europe</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>BREAKFAST</strong></p><p><strong><em>The Hairy Fig</em></strong>: Expect homemade scones and pastries at this pretty Italian café on Fossgate.</p><p><strong><em>1331</em></strong>: A cosy candlelit bar in the evening, 1331 starts the day as an airy cafe serving the best blueberry pancakes in the city. Their Full Englishes are also a winner too.</p><p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p><p><strong><em>Shambles Market</em></strong>: It’s always important to support local businesses when you travel! If it’s sunny, indulge in the food stalls and take a picnic at York Museum Gardens!</p><p><strong><em>Ye Olde Sausage Pie Shoppe</em></strong>: If it’s thick, freshly baked pies you’re after, then there are few better places than this iconic pie shop on the Shambles.</p><p><strong><em>The York Roast Company</em></strong>: Found on the shopping street of Stonegate, the York Roast Company has immortalised itself in British food trends by perfecting the Sunday Roast Yorkshire Roll – yes, it is as good as it sounds.</p><p><strong>DINNER</strong></p><p><strong><em>Love Cheese</em></strong>: A wine bar behind a cheese shop which calls itself a “Speakcheesy.” A cute garden serving up rustic pizzas and artisanal cheese boards.</p><p><strong><em>Forest</em></strong>: Opposite Grape Lane is one of York’s most picturesque restaurants serving great food too.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Guy-Fawkes-Pub-york.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Fawkes Pub\" height=\"503\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Guy Fawkes Pub. Photo by Joshua Symons</p><h2><strong>WHERE TO DRINK</strong></h2><p><strong><em>FOR WINE</em></strong>: A women-owned business, Pairings is one of the best wine bars in the city, serving up Spanish tapas with French vibes. The perfect blend!</p><p><strong><em>FOR PUBS</em></strong>: For a taste of history, the Guy Fawkes Inn is a must-visit. It was home to the infamous rebel, Guy Fawkes, who failed in his plan to blow up Parliament in 1605.</p><p><strong><em>FOR A COCKTAIL</em></strong>: Bora Bora is a fun, no-frills cocktail bar tucked around the corner of Swinegate in the City Centre, allowing you to escape to the Bahamas in the middle of Yorkshire!</p><h2><strong>TOP TIP</strong></h2><p>Despite York’s beauty, the city is not a playground for tourists. Please be respectful when you’re visiting the city and taking photos as locals and workers will be going about their business. The streets are incredibly narrow and get very busy.</p><p>If you want the city to yourself, get up at the crack of dawn and you’ll find many of the roads will be a lot quieter.</p>', 8, 3, '2023-05-31 12:49:39', 'international', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/york-travel.jpg'),

Photo by Kontiki Expeditions</p><p>Looking at the luxurious Kontiki Wayra, you would never guess its humble beginnings. Ecuadorian Carlos Núñez found the ship abandoned in a local shipyard several years ago. He immediately saw its potential and considered restoring it for cruises to the Galapagos.</p><p>Then he got the idea of restoring it for expeditions along the Ecuadorian Coast. He wanted to showcase the region’s nature reserves, traditions, culture and gastronomy.</p><p>“The coast is the perfect mix of nature and culture,” he says. “Even Ecuadoreans don’t know how much the coast offers. It’s an untapped gem for tourism. There are no crowds; it’s affordable and authentic.”</p><p>The company began cruising in 2021, offering five-to-eight-night cruises.&nbsp;The 18-passenger superyacht has almost a 1:1 staff ratio, and our every need is fulfilled – even before we think of it. We’re greeted with hot chocolate when we come in after swimming and the staff remembers the way I like my morning coffee.</p><p>Meals onboard are carefully prepared with fresh seafood and local ingredients. Many of the dishes are popular Ecuadorian favorites, highlighting the best of the region.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ruly-mescal.jpg\" alt=\"Ruly Mescal, left, spent more than 30 years as a naturalist in the Galapagos.\" height=\"800\" width=\"600\"></p><p>Ruly Mescal, left, spent more than 30 years as a naturalist in the Galapagos.</p><p>With such a small group of passengers, we get to know our fellow cruisers, which makes the experience even better. Ruhul Mescal – or Ruly as everyone calls him – is our onboard naturalist. He spent more than 30 years working as a naturalist in the Galapagos, which means he knows the country’s wildlife and regions well. Each evening, we gather in the main room to learn more from him about the communities and regions we’ll be visiting.</p><p><strong>More to Ecuador than the Galapagos</strong></p><p>“Ecuador is much more than the Galapagos Islands,” he says. “The mainland of this beautiful country has a lot to offer. You read about the Galapagos, the Amazon and the Andean Zone, which are wonderful, but you rarely read about the coast of Ecuador. To me, it’s a real pleasure to be a part of pioneering organized tourism at this level in such a beautiful place – the coast of Ecuador.”</p><p>“The communities we’re visiting along the coast are not touristy,” he continues. “You’ll still find little villages and people living the way their ancestors used to. There is a lot to experience. What I really like about this cruise is that we can introduce you to local Ecuadorians themselves. You get to experience our beautiful country in an authentic way.”</p><p>True to his word, we meet many fascinating people and communities along the journey.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/clay-pottery-in-Ayangue.jpg\" alt=\"The Orrala family.

On its quiet beach, we watch as local children play with their dog in the surf, while two young men sit in their fishing boat, repairing nets for the next day’s work.</p><p>We walk along the shore to the studios of the Orrala family. Their beautiful ceramic work is well known. The family has spent decades researching the ancient Valdivian people of the region, whose civilization dates to 3500 BCE. The Orrala family’s archeological digs have located many well-preserved pieces of ancient pottery.</p><p>Today, the family produces beautiful pottery following those pre-Colombian ceramic traditions. At their studio on the beach, we take an outdoor pottery class from them.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pottery-class.jpg\" alt=\"Pottery class in Ecuador.

Photo courtesy Janna Graber</p><p>We start by filtering red mud until it’s a stick-free, lumpy consistency. Then they show us how to knead it into a lump of clay. Finally, we create our own bowls from dirt that was just minutes ago watery mud.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s relaxing working the clay, and we laugh as we get our hands dirty. They give each of us a tiny ceramic pendant that will grace my Christmas tree in December, and I purchase a beautiful bowl that I know I’ll use for years to come.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/orrala-pottery.jpg\" alt=\"Ceramic pieces by the Orrala family \" height=\"638\" width=\"850\"></p><p>Beautiful pieces by the Orrala family.

Out in the bay, the Kontiki bobs in the sea, waiting for our return.&nbsp;</p><p>Dinner onboard that night is a lovely affair, with each meal showing careful attention to detail. Our group laughs as we discuss fun memories of the day.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Shaman-blessing-Ecuador-1.jpg\" alt=\"Shaman blessing in Ecuador.

The community takes pride in their ancestral heritage, and they have developed an eco-tourism infrastructure that benefits the whole community.</p><p>Visitors are welcome. There’s a small outdoor museum where we learn about the past, and then we walk through the forest, where we receive a blessing – a sort of purification ritual – from a local shaman.</p><p>He carefully explains the meaning of their peaceful ritual and then invites us to take part. We are each blessed with smoke and water, and then follow his lead as we stand to bless our brothers in the north, in the west, in the south and in the east.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end, he gives us each a hug. It’s an experience I’ll remember for years.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>HIKING IN MACHALILLA NATIONAL PARK ON ISLA DE LA PLATA</strong></h2><p>The next day we get to see one of the celebrities of Ecuador, the blue-footed boobies that are often seen in the Galapagos. The unusual birds are found here along the coast, too, at Machalilla National Park on Isla de la Plata. The island is well protected, and you can only visit with a certified guide.</p><p><br></p><p>As we hike along the dusty trails, our guide tells us about the wildlife on the island. Then near the top, we see them – the famous birds with blue webbed feet.</p><p> <img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/blue-footed-boobies-ecuador.jpg\" alt=\"Blue-footed booby with chick.

The birds lay two eggs at different times in the hopes that at least one survives. We also see booby birds with white, red and brown webbed feet.</p><p>The birds pay us no mind. They often build nests along the well-trodden trail and ignore those who quietly walk by.</p><p><strong>Iche Manabita Cuisine School and Cacao Beans</strong></p><p>Incredible as its wildlife is, there’s much more to see in Ecuador. The country is the birthplace of cacao, going back more than 5,000 years, and we learn about that the next day.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/students-at-iche.jpg\" alt=\"Culinary students at Iche Manabita Cuisine School.

The school has 12 very talented students who come for seven months to attend culinary classes led by head chef, Valentina&nbsp;Álvarez. They attend other classes too, including communications, history, archeology, and sustainable tourism.</p><p>While the students prepare our lunch, we meet Servio Pachard Vera, a local organic cacao farmer. His family’s plantation has preserved some of the oldest cacao trees in the world.</p><p>They grow the rare, heirloom Arriba Nacional cacao. For centuries, it has been prized by<strong>&nbsp;</strong>chocolatiers for its fragrant aroma and signature flavor profile. Many Swiss chocolate companies use cacao from this region.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cacao-farmer-in-ecuador.jpg\" alt=\"Servio Pachard Vera, a local organic cacao farmer.

Photo by Benjamin Rader</p><p>Servio shows us several types of cacao varieties, and we get to taste their sweet ripe seeds. Cacao beans are technically not beans, but the fruit of the cacao tree. Each pod produces about 35-50 seeds surrounded in sweet pulp. Sure enough, we can taste the subtle difference in each variety.</p><p><br></p><p>After separating out the beans, he shows us how to roast them over a fire. We take turns stirring and then grinding the roasted beans. Then, he mixes the ground cacao with a small amount of sugar and pours tiny cups of hot cacao to drink. It’s like drinking a piece of dark chocolate. I’ll never view hot chocolate the same.</p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%20viewBox=\'0%200%20850%20638\'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"The food is almost too pretty to eat.

The student chefs have created beautiful, delicious works of art that almost seem too good to eat. But of course, we do, enjoying every bite.</p><p><strong>Hiking at Pacoche Wildlife Refuge</strong></p><p>The next day, we head to the cloud forest at Pacoche Wildlife Refuge. Kontiki has provided all of us with rubber boots, so we can hike through small streams and the forest with ease. Our local naturalist guide shows us howler monkeys, lots of colorful birds and even a tarantula peacefully guarding her nest.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hiking-rainforest-Ecuador.jpg\" alt=\"HIking at Pocoche Wildlife Refuge.

This county has many fine hat makers, and we meet one of them — fifth-generation master weaver Domingo Carranza.</p><p>Carranza is a specialist in Ecuadorian toquilla straw hats, which are made entirely of palm fronds. Hats can take weeks or even months to make, depending on the weave.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Panama-hats-are-made-in-Ecuador.jpg\" alt=\"fifth-generation master weaver Domingo Carranza\" height=\"568\" width=\"850\"></p><p>Fifth-generation master weaver Domingo Carranza</p><p>He shows us how they are made, and we watch in awe as his hands fly across the weave.

Kontiki had arranged a two-day pre-visit for us in Quito. We stayed at the ILLA Experience Hotel, a lovely boutique property near Quito’s historic center.

Typical prices for evening performances start at around 3,300 HUF (US$ 17).</p><p>Even if you don’t choose to enjoy an evening of pirouettes or arias, a 45-minute daytime tour of the opera house leaves many visitors in awe.</p><p>Until as recently as 1873, Budapest (located in northern Hungary) was two distinct cities —the hilly Buda and the flat Pest — separated by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/travel-in-budapest-twin-cities-on-the-danube/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Danube</strong></a>&nbsp;River.</p><p>Budapest today is a vibrant city that offers exceptional cultural offerings, as well as city walks, seasonal festivals and museums brimming with everything from art and history to more unusual sights — such as the intriguing mummified arm of King István, Hungary’s first Christian king, in St. Stephen’s Basilica.</p><h2><strong>ENJOY THE COFFEE SHOPS AND PASTRIES</strong></h2><p>Central Budapest is packed with dozens of coffee shops. Diets should be left at home, as you’ll easily find your powers of resistance being tested to the limit while here, given the array of sweet treats and cakes available in the city’s charming coffeehouses.</p><p>One decadent pastry you should seek out is&nbsp;<em>retes</em>, a flaky strudel filled with apples, cherries, cheese or poppy seeds. Perhaps the best place to begin sightseeing is along the main street of Andrassy Avenue, in Pest, where the Hungarian State Opera House is nestled among a clutch of retail shops, smart restaurants and cafes.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Downtown-Budapest.-Photo-courtesy-of-Visit-Hungary.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Budapest.

Photo courtesy of Visit Hungary</p><p>Opposite the opera house, Muvesz Kavehaz — Artist Coffeehouse — (Andrassy ut 29) stands out from the crowd. This traditional Hungarian coffee shop displays a character of its own. Baroque-style mirrors lend a sense of elegance and expansiveness, and wicker chairs clustered around small cafe tables add to the atmosphere.</p><p>Temptingly displayed cakes, tortes and pastries are ideal accompaniments for steaming cups of strong, dark&nbsp;<em>kave</em>.</p><p>If you enjoy walking (and what better way is there to burn off those slices of&nbsp;<em>torta</em>?), you’ll appreciate Budapest’s myriad streets geared toward pedestrians. The city’s beautiful scenery and numerous walking routes are perfect for everything from laidback strolls to invigorating walks.</p><p>Notable walks include the peaceful greenery of Margaret Island (some 2.5 km long and positioned in the middle of the Danube, the island is accessible by foot or tram) and Buda Hills, home to the Budakeszi Game Preserve.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Fisherman-Bastion.-Photo-courtesy-of-Visit-Hungary.jpg\" alt=\"Fisherman Bastion.

Photo courtesy of Visit Hungary</p><h2><strong>YOU’LL FIND MANY EXAMPLES OF STUNNING ARCHITECTURE</strong></h2><p>While walking through the city, don’t forget to look up, down and all around, as you’ll find stunning examples of architecture, including many buildings in the Art Nouveau style.</p><p>Across the Széchenyi Chain Bridge, on the Buda side of the city, is the Castle District. Composed of Castle Hill and Watertown, this area is steeped in regal, military and religious history. Sixty meters above the Danube, Castle Hill is built over an extensive network of caves — spanning some 28 km (17 m) in total — carved into the landscape by thermal springs.</p><p>Along with sights such as the Royal Palace, the Vienna Gate and the neo-Gothic-style Matthias Church (Mátyás Templom), you’ll find a range of museums on Castle Hill, including the Museum of Military History, the Golden Eagle Pharmacy Museum and the Hungarian National Gallery.</p><p>The latter is home to permanent collections by noted Hungarian artists. Some of the major works of art here are the Baroque works of Jakab Bogdany, and 20th-century pieces by artist Karoly Ferenczy and sculptor Ferenc Medgyessy. Several major bridges span the Danube.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Budapest-City-Park-Ice-Rink.-Photo-courtesy-of-Visit-Hungary.jpg\" alt=\"Budapest City Park Ice Rink.

This oldest bridge in Budapest offers more than a walkway for pedestrians; pause at any point on the bridge and you’ll be treated to fantastic views and photo opportunities galore.</p><p>The House of Hungarian Wines (Szentháromság ter 6) can also be found on Castle Hill. Visitors here can learn about Hungary’s 22 wine-growing regions while sampling choice selections during a tasting tour.</p><h2><strong>THE CITY WAS BUILT ON THERMAL SPRINGS</strong></h2><p>One of Budapest’s defining characteristics is that it was built upon approximately 100 thermal springs (about 1,000 springs are found throughout Hungary), which form the basis for the city’s renowned spas.</p><p>The city is home to around four dozen spas, ranging from medical and therapeutic spas to public baths. A number of major hotels offer spas; the grande dame of them all is the famed Gellért Thermal Bath (Szent Gellért ter 1), in the luxurious Gellért Hotel .</p><p>The waters from this spring were originally channeled by the Romans into public baths. The Gellért Thermal Bath, built in 1918, offers a wide range of options, including a thermal pool, an effervescent pool and a wave pool. A naturist sunbathing deck, along with a large outdoor pool, is open from April through September.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gellert-Thermal-Bath.-Photo-courtesy-of-Visit-Hungary.jpg\" alt=\"Gellért Thermal Bath.

Photo courtesy of Visit Hungary</p><p>A trip to Budapest wouldn’t be complete without a stroll through the Great Market Hall (IX Fovam ter)<em>&nbsp;—</em>&nbsp;also known as the Central Market Hall — the biggest covered, indoor food market in the city.</p><p>The Great Market Hall is a food-lover’s paradise, where you can find stall upon stall offering a colorful display of meats, fish, deli items, wines, fruits, cheese, vegetables — and of course, that Hungarian staple, paprika.</p><p>The spice can be purchased here in all sorts of forms, including dried, crushed, fresh, on a string or pickled, in a jar. If the sight and smell of all the wares start to make you feel hungry&nbsp;(and it inevitably will), you can join the locals upstairs and do what the locals do by purchasing traditional Hungarian fare such as&nbsp;<em>csirke&nbsp;paprikas</em>&nbsp;(chicken paprika) or&nbsp;<em>gulyas</em>&nbsp;(goulash) from food stalls.</p><p><strong>If You Go</strong>:</p><p>Budapest is a beautifully engaging city that can easily be compared to other hip Central European cities of note, such as Prague or Warsaw; yet&nbsp;Budapest has retained its own unique&nbsp;<em>Magyar</em>&nbsp;character and charm.

(20, 'EXPLORING ALFAMA: LISBON’S OLDEST AND MOST AUTHENTIC NEIGHBORHOOD', '<p>Our favorite area to stay in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/things-to-do-in-lisbon-portugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Lisbon</strong></a>&nbsp;is Alfama. It’s as ancient as Lisbon itself, being the oldest neighborhood of the city, founded in 1200 BCE. The rustic neighborhood looks like something out of a sketch from centuries ago.</p><p>Historic apartment buildings with red-clay roofs are everywhere. Cobblestone side streets twist through the hillsides connecting little squares. Plus decorative tiles mark doorways and locals sell liquor from their windows—or hang laundry from them.</p><p>There’s more to Lisbon than Alfama, and certainly more impressive things to see. Some individual sights in Belem and other parts of the city are more impressive, but there’s just something about the authenticity of Alfama Lisbon.</p><p>Beneath the layer of tourism, we’re still walking on the same cobblestoned streets, up and down the same hills, through the same buildings that existed here before the great earthquake of 1775.</p><p>Other neighborhoods have been rebuilt after one disaster or another, but not Alfama. Moreso than in other parts of Lisbon, what you see in Alfama is what you would have seen 200 years ago.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Egg-custards.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Egg custards\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Egg custards. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>PORTUGUESE COFFEE AND EGG CUSTARD</strong></h2><p>Our first stop when we arrived at Lisbon’s Santa Apolonia Station around 9 am was a simple little cafe for Portuguese coffee and egg custard.</p><p>We reached it by crossing over the parking square, between the train station and the Military Museum’s decorative façade and walking through the sidewalk tables and yellow umbrellas.</p><p>This was our second visit to Lisbon and we were familiar with this little square and café. Our adult and teenage kids, Nicole and Alex, had been talking about egg custards for a while.</p><p>My wife, Nataliya, and I had been too, along with the strong Portuguese coffee. And we wanted to make this little hole-in-the-wall café our first destination.</p><p>Nothing exceptional, but special to us because of its simplicity. There was an old man at the counter serving coffee and pastries and locals were sitting and reading newspapers, drinking coffee and having quiet conversations.</p><p>With the help of a customer who spoke English and a bit of pointing, we ordered our strong Portuguese coffee, tea and pastries as we waited for our host, Carlos, to find us where he left us years before.</p><p>Carolos greeted us at the café and helped us with our bags as we walked just a few buildings down to his: a corner building at the roots of the Alfama.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-Streets-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"Streets of Alfama Lisbon\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Streets of Alfama. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>AT HOME IN ALFAMA LISBON</strong></h2><p>The spacious flat stood right on the square across from Apolonia Station and next to the Military Museum. Located on the second floor, our flat included an entryway, office, three bedrooms, kitchen, dining room and bathroom. The building was historic on the outside but completely new on the inside.</p><p>This was one of a few flats that Carlos and his family had purchased to renovate as guest houses. Knowing that the biggest and fastest-growing industry in Lisbon today was tourism.</p><p>The busy cafés bustled below. From our bedroom window, we could see both the river and the statuary adorning the military museum beside us.</p><p>The Alfama brings to mind a sort of old-world San Francisco. There are steep hills and yellow and red trollies roll by regularly, twisting through the narrow, curvy, hilly streets.</p><p>These days they are filled more with tourists than local passengers. In fact, we’ve learned that it’s best to avoid hopping onto the popular Tram 28 unless you want to be taken for a ride.</p><p>Looking at the area today, it’s hard to believe that Alfama was once the wealthiest part of Lisbon. Fear of earthquakes motivated wealthy residents to flee to other areas. Ironic, since Alfama is the only neighborhood to survive the big earthquake.</p><p>Struggling fishermen and workers populated the Alfama in 1775 during the earthquake that saw the rest of Lisbon suffer. Their spirit lives in the neighborhood today.</p><p>Come to think of it, Alfama is much like that first café we wanted to hit upon returning. Nothing exceptional, but special to us because of its simplicity. Alfama is not necessarily magnificent or notable, but it is pleasing and comfortable in its authenticity.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Military-Museum-courtyard.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Military Museum courtyard\" height=\"422\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Military Museum courtyard. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>MUSEUMS IN ALFAMA LISBON</strong></h2><p>The Military Museum was easy to find since it was just next to our flat. However,&nbsp;it’s easy for anyone to find because it’s just across from Santa Apolonia’s train station. The building itself is a beautifully embellished 16th-century cannon foundry and weapons storehouse.</p><p>Today it showcases old cannons, weapons and military items from throughout the ages, from flints and spears to guns and cannons. Beautiful coats of arms and crests decorate the rooms and doorways.</p><p>The walls and ceilings of the rooms themselves look more like those of a palace than barracks. This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/national-museums-in-lisbon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Lisbon museum</strong></a>&nbsp;stands its ground against other museums in the city.</p><p>One such other museum is Casa dos Bicos or House of Diamonds. The former home of Nobel Prize-winning author Jose Saramango is now a museum dedicated to his work. The permanent exhibition of Saramango’s work, including multiple copies of his books in multiple languages, is impressive.</p><p>However, it’s the façade of the building, covered in diamond-shaped stones, a style popular in the 1500s, that most people find most interesting.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-A-walk-along-the-cobblestone-streets.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"A walk along the cobblestone streets\" height=\"422\" width=\"750\"></p><p>A walk along the cobblestone streets. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>STROLL THE COBBLESTONE STREETS</strong></h2><p>“<em>What are we going to do now?”&nbsp;</em>Nicole asked.</p><p>“<em>Probably walk around some more,”</em>&nbsp;Alex said.</p><p>One of our favorite things to do in Alfama Lisbon is to simply explore the winding streets without a map. Each time you set out for a stroll across the cobblestone you discover new things or are greeted by old favorites.</p><p>Like the hole-in-the-wall Gingija bar we visited every couple days during both visits. Just an open door, one table for two on the street, another table for two inside, and a small bar large enough for three people to stand at. People walk up and order their Gingija or Port, beer, wine, or coffee.</p><p><br></p><p>They have a quick drink and perhaps a short conversation, then pay the barkeep and move on. We enjoyed seeing the familiar, friendly faces behind the bar each time we returned for another refreshment.</p><p>“<em>We made some regular friends last time we were here,”</em>&nbsp;Nataliya reminisced. Many of the same locals, Brits, and other European visitors would show up each time we visited. After a few visits, sometimes the bartender would tell us what we wanted instead of the other way around.</p><p>A stroll through Alfama always features beautiful blue, yellow and full-color tiles, often hand-painted, decorating houses and buildings. The tiles displayed scenes of Fado, of historic figures, religious images, ships and battles. There was even a map of Alfama rendered in blue and white.</p><p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\'%20viewBox=\'0%200%20750%20563\'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"Tile in a courtyard\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Tile in a courtyard. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>MIRADOURO DE SANTA LUIZA</strong></h2><p>Sometimes you come across an entire courtyard filled with decorative tile and offering an amazing view of the city of Lisbon. An example of this is Miradouro de Santa Luiza—a terrace next to a church with a sweeping view over Alfama and the river.</p><p>You can usually find tourists here taking pictures. But also street musicians playing Portuguese Guitarra, old men playing cards and street artists selling their painted tiles and watercolors.&nbsp;</p><p>Next to the terrace is the church that gives it its name: Santa Luiza, built in the 12th&nbsp;century. You just can’t miss the white façade with its striking red door. But the highlight of this church for most visitors, including us, is the blue and white tiles depicting historic scenes on the exterior wall in the terrace.</p><p>Just beyond the terrace, we visited the Museum of Decorative Arts, a nice little institute that has been preserving the traditions of Portuguese decorative arts since the 1950s. Here we took in the ceramics, textiles, porcelain, and of course, tile panels.</p><p>The museum guards often simply sit in chairs and tell people not to touch. However, here they offered to tell us about some of the interesting pieces of decorative furniture.</p><p>We even enjoyed a demonstration of how to apply gold leaf to woodwork. This was something that may come in handy as we consider refreshing some of our antique frames back home.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-Interior-of-Se-Cathedral.-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of Se Cathedral\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Interior of Se Cathedral. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>ALFAMA’S RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE</strong></h2><p>The Alfama is most known for its hilly streets, authentic architecture, sweeping views and old-world feel. But the other thing that struck us during our time in the neighborhood was the beautiful churches, featuring styles and scales as diverse as the people visiting them.</p><p>Lisbon’s cathedral is Se, built in 1150 on the site of an old mosque. Its twin bell towers and the rose window over the arched door between them characterize the Se Cathedral.</p><p>Perhaps not the best location, it was destroyed by earthquakes three times in the 14th&nbsp;century. And again, in the big one of 1755.</p><p>Inside, the carved tombs of 14th-century nobles show their stone bodies at rest on top. They are, clutching prayer books and have dogs resting or fighting for table scraps at their feet. The church features individual chapels, a gothic cloister and a treasury with relics, robes and silver.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Pantheon.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Alfama Pantheon\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Alfama Pantheon. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>SANTA ENGRACIA</strong></h2><p>The gleaming white dome of Santa Engracia, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/things-to-do-in-porto-portugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Portugal</strong></a>’s National Pantheon, can’t be missed. Construction started on this Baroque monument in the 1600s but was not completed until 1966.</p><p>“<em>Maybe this is where Gaudi was inspired to go with a hundred-year-plus timeline for building his Sagrada Familia in Barcelona,”</em>&nbsp;I suggested. But the teenager didn’t roll his eyes for long—there was too much to see.</p><p>Inside, the enormous interior of Santa Engracia felt grand. The floor was tiled with multicolored marble and sun shone in through the cupola. On display were cenotaphs of Portuguese heroes, like Vasco da Gama and Alfonso de Albuquerque.&nbsp;</p><p>We climbed the stairs, with a rest stop halfway up, for a view of the interior from above. Eventually, we came to the top, where we could walk out on the wide-open roof for an amazing view of the city and a close-up of the dome from the outside. It was extremely windy when we visited; I had to hold on to the hat that I removed when I entered the church.</p><p>Beware: in order to come back down, you must first return inside and walk around a narrow, circular passage that wraps the interior of the dome.</p><p>The railing is low, the balcony is high, and the path is narrow. Vertigo sufferers may want to sneak back down the up path. The view—inside and out—is worth it.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-View-of-Alfama.-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"View of Alfama Lisbon\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>View of Alfama. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>RELAX IN THE PARK</strong></h2><p>Back outside, not far from the Pantheon, is a community park. Here you can sit on a bench and enjoy a panoramic view. Or, use any of a number of exercise contraptions to work the muscles you haven’t been working while walking up and down the hills of Alfama. We tried out some of the metal machines in the park, just for fun.</p><p>We happened to be passing by this way at the right time. On Saturday and Thursday, there is a Feira da Ladra, or “thieves’ market.” It’s a sort of flea market, with some of the vendors regulars and others coming occasionally with their goods.</p><p>Nataliya found a great deal on a large, hand-painted ceramic pitcher from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/coimbra-portugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Coimbra</strong></a>. It was a fraction of what it would have cost new in one of the shops we had visited there. After such a steal, we felt the need to repent, so we decided to go back to church.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Church-of-Saint-Anthony-interior.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Alfama Church of Saint Anthony interior\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Church of Saint Anthony interior. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>CITY OF SAINTS</strong></h2><p>Santo Antonio church is built on the ground where the house of St. Anthony’s birth once stood. After the original church was destroyed in the big earthquake in the 1700s, local children crossed the community begging “a small coin for St. Anthony.” People parted with their coins to restore the church.</p><p>When we visited, coins continued to decorate the floor of the little chapel in the crypt. A blue and white tile depicts Pope John Paul II’s visit in 1995. It’s a small church, but you can’t miss it. A statue of St. Anthony with a child on his shoulder stands in front of it.</p><p>Or just pray to St. Anthony, the Patron Saint of lost things. He’s sure to help you find it.</p><p>Another church worth finding is Sao Vincente de Fora, noticeable for its off-white Italian Renaissance-style façade. St. Vincent is Lisbon’s patron saint, and his statue stands over the entrance.</p><p>A baroque canopy decorates the altar, and the monastery features a cloister with decorative tiles. An interesting highlight is the tomb of Carlos I with the stone statue of a woman praying before it, her clothing appearing real from certain angles.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-Castelo-de-Sao-Jorge.-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"Castelo de Sao Jorge\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Castelo de Sao Jorge. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>STORMING THE CASTLE</strong></h2><p>A light rain began as we continued up the cobblestone paths toward the castle. It seemed like an appropriate time to storm the Castelo de Sao Jorge.</p><p>After retaking this mountaintop site from the Moors in 1147, the king transformed the citadel into a royal residence. Little remains of the original castle, rebuilt in the early 1900s to appear as it did during medieval times. But it’s still fun and interesting to explore.</p><p>We walked along the battlements, climbing the towers for great views. A terrace offered panoramic views of Lisbon and the river below.</p><p>Gardens populated with trees and peacocks made for a fun, lazy afternoon. The peacocks even perched in trees and strutted around outdoor cafes waiting for food—almost like beautiful pigeons.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-Castelo-de-Sao-Jorge-at-night.-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"Castelo de Sao Jorge at night.\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Castelo de Sao Jorge at night. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>TORRE DA IGREJA DO CASTELO DE SAO JORGE</strong></h2><p>Beside the castle is the charming little Torre Da Igreja do Castelo de Sao Jorge. It seemed to escape most tourists since it blended in with the neighborhood landscape. It’s not as polished as some tourist sights, but that gave it a more authentic feel.</p><p>The tour began as our guide poured us a Portuguese drink: port, liquor, beer, wine, or juice. I had a port, Nataliya tried a green wine, Nicole went with red and Alex had a Portuguese beer.</p><p>With our glasses in hand, we climbed the bell tower, where we took our time standing between the bells and enjoying the incredible view of the castle grounds from one side, the river from another and the rooftops of Lisbon from another.</p><p>Three bells hung in the four open arches. After enjoying the view—and our drinks—we returned to the base of the tower. We were then escorted to the old church that appeared to be a dusty relic itself from a time long passed.</p><p>A thick man in a suit stopped us as we began to enter the church. “<em>No, this is not a tour site</em>.”</p><p>“<em>But we have tickets</em>,” I said.</p><p>“<em>This is a funeral</em>,” he said.</p><p>The guide who sold us the tickets was quick to intervene, escorting us away from the main entrance of the working church and through another entry.</p><p>Fortunately, the church was empty and there was no funeral service taking place. But it did look like they might be preparing for one given the somber, darkened interior. We didn’t spend long in the church, but the visit to the bell tower was worth the visit.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ALFAMA-LISBON.jpg\" alt=\"The neighborhood of Alfama, Lisbon is the oldest and most authentic in the city with winding cobblestone streets and charm on every corner. #Lisbon #Portugal\" height=\"750\" width=\"500\"></p><h2><strong>ART IN ALFAMA, LISBON</strong></h2><p>Walking down from the castle area, a woman leaning in her upstairs apartment window yelled down at tourists who bumped her clothes that were hanging to dry below. Vendors stood on the edges of the cobblestone path, selling everything from painted tiles to paintings, sawed-out coins to cork purses and hats.</p><p>Continuing our stroll down from the castle, we entered the pleasant art gallery of Ukrainian-born Stepan Zaporozhan, where he served as a sort of living art installation himself, working on a painting in front of customers. Several half-finished works were scattered around him. And hundreds of completed works—oils, watercolors, tiles—hung on the walls.</p><p>His son greeted us when we entered and showed us around. Portuguese guitar-infused covers of songs by Paul Simon, Guns and Roses, and Leonard Cohen played softly in the background as we selected some art. We learned that he worked as a street artist himself for several years before earning enough to open his own gallery.&nbsp;</p><p>“<em>These are beautiful,”</em>&nbsp;Nataliya complimented.</p><p>“<em>A lot better than the factory-pressed ones out in the souvenir shops,”</em>&nbsp;I said.</p><p>Alex browsed some of the postcard-sized limited prints. “<em>Can I get one?”</em></p><p>As we picked out a few original items, we had a conversation about the current situation in Ukraine, his family still back home, and how fortunate he and his immediate family were to be in Lisbon during the war.</p><p>Before leaving the castle district, we stopped off for a snack on Tram 28. Not the actual tram, but a restaurant located within an old tram car, complete with diner-style booths and trolly-style bars.</p><p>“<em>Too bad this thing doesn’t work,”</em>&nbsp;Nicole said. “<em>We could ride our way back down while we eat.</em>”</p><p>“<em>If it worked,”</em>&nbsp;I said, “<em>we probably would have ridden it up while we ate</em>.”</p><p>Instead, we ate and walked our way back down the cobblestone path.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-Fado-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"Men playing Fado in the street\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Fado in the street. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>FINDING FADO</strong></h2><p>No stay in the Alfama is complete without experiencing fado. It’s hard to escape even if you try. Walking through the streets at night, you’ll hear the music wafting from open-doored restaurants and cafes at every corner.</p><p>Fado is like the Portuguese version of the blues. Many of the songs originate from a time when women sang sadly about their sailor husbands who never returned from sea.</p><p>But be careful stepping into a fado establishment without looking it over first. Otherwise, you may be wailing a fado-esque tune about the loss of your money.</p><p>While enjoying a fado concert is a wonderful experience, some fado restaurants are notorious for ripping people off. Food and drink at a fado restaurant will be two to three times what you pay for the same food elsewhere, and that’s to be expected as payment for the entertainment.</p><p>In fact, one fado restaurant that we went to accidentally gave us both a fado and non-fado menu, where everything was the same except for the prices. The people luring you in will tell you that the show is free if you have dinner, and it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;worth overpaying for the food so that you can enjoy the music.</p><p>But we’ve learned to take a close look at our bill before paying because they may charge for the music they promised was being paid for by overpriced food.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Fado-Tile.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fado Tile\" height=\"422\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Fado Tile. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><p>Our friendly waiter was quick to put snacks on the table, some of them being snacks we didn’t want. So began a game of push and pull, moving them to the side and finding them back at the center. We had to make it clear that we didn’t want the things we didn’t want so they wouldn’t appear on our bill.</p><p>When traveling in another country, we usually prefer to pay in cash using the local currency—in this case, Euros. But sometimes it pays to use a credit card as a layer of protection. For fado and certain restaurants, we sometimes pay by card so we have the option of contesting the charge if we notice something wrong later.</p><p>Cashing out can be hectic with the loud music and dark room, or, in some cases, a rush of people leaving between sets or during a rushed closing time.</p><p>There are dozens of fado restaurants in Alfama ranging from shady to trendy. There are two that we really enjoyed, each offering a different experience.</p><p>For rustic, folksy experience, we enjoyed Tasca do Chico.</p><p>For a pricier, glitzier show-club experience, Clube de Fadois a good choice.</p><p>In either place, we expect the music and overall experience to take precedence over the food.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alfama-Lisbon-Fado-Guiterra.-Image-from-Canva.jpg\" alt=\"Fado Guiterra\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Fado Guiterra. Image from Canva</p><h2><strong>FADO MUSEUM</strong></h2><p>Another way to enjoy fado is at the Fado Museum, in front of a small square in Alfama, Lisbon. However, during our visit, there was little fado to be heard within the walls of the museum.</p><p>Exhibits of pictures, instruments, and video clips revealed the story of Fado’s history. Listening stations (at least the ones that worked) allowed us to put on headphones to hear samples.</p><p>The Fado Museum is worthwhile, but it’s not the best of the museums in Lisbon if time is limited, nor is it the best way to experience Fado.</p><p>The best way to learn about fado is to experience it in the air around you, in an authentic setting. To walk into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, often owned by fado musicians themselves, and sit back and feel the soulful music.</p><p>As long as we remember to establish the price, refuse the unwanted snacks, and double-check the bill, a night of fado leaves us feeling much happier than the sad music would seem to imply.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Rooftops-and-churches.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Alfama Rooftops and churches\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Rooftops and churches. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>IF YOU GO</strong></h2><p>Tourism has boomed in Lisbon, and even with the pandemic, we could see a difference between our visits in 2016 and 2022. The extra tourism dollars have created some more polished squares and posh restaurants.</p><p>However, the city still has a rustic, undiscovered feel to it compared to more widely visited cities in Europe. And a lower price tag to go with it. Plus there’s no shortage of places to stay as entrepreneurs have created a number of nice furnished apartments in historic buildings.&nbsp;</p><p>We booked a nice-sized, three-bedroom flat with a kitchen for a week that cost less than a hotel. And wherever you are in Alfama, Lisbon you’re within walking distance of just about everything.&nbsp;</p><p>Vehicles are a commodity in Lisbon. Everything is within walking distance, and if you don’t feel like climbing the cobblestoned hills, there are trams, taxis, and even public elevators.</p><p>Taxis are inexpensive, especially if traveling with two or more people. Even to and from the airport, you’ll save money and get door-to-door service with a taxi if there are three or more.</p>', 16, 4, '2023-05-31 13:11:05', 'economy', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alfama-Egg-custards.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg'),

Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas\" height=\"600\" width=\"800\"></p><p>An elderly woman and her beloved dog in Plaza San Francisco. Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas</p><p>On that brilliant blue sky morning, there was a great deal of activity in the bustling Plaza San Francisco in Quito, Ecuador.</p><p>I watched a small group of raucous men in a corner, apparently recovering from the festivities of the night before, an elderly indigenous woman petting her beloved dog, the requisite shoeshine man hard at work and two women in bowler hats speaking Quechua, the ancient language dating back to the Incas which millions of Ecuadorians still speak.</p><p>“May I take your photo,” I asked them in Spanish.</p><p>“<em>Claro que sí</em>,” they consented with a big smile. “As long as we can see the results! We don’t have cameras.” They shyly posed and leaned over to see themselves. “<em>Gracias</em>,” they said to me happily.</p><p>Dating from the 1500s, the plaza fronts the opulent marble palace-like Casa Gangotena boutique hotel. The ornately decorated San Francisco Church and Convent lines one side of the enormous cobblestone-paved square.</p><p>In every direction, at this sunny, crisp early hour, there were moms with their youngsters in tow, scurrying off to school – some while balancing their breakfast plates in hand.</p><h2><strong>CHOCOLATE AND PANAMA HATS</strong></h2><p>Many people know little about Ecuador. They might not know that chocolate originated in Ecuador, not in Mexico. Or that it boasts 75 volcanoes (62 of them over 12,500 feet,) or that Ecuador is one of the world’s leading producers of roses – and they are magnificent, aromatic specimens, as big as peonies.</p><p>Ecuador is also where those fine Panama hats (really named&nbsp;<em>Toquilla</em>&nbsp;hats) come from — they were called Panama hats because the laborers on the canal wore them.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2660.jpg\" alt=\"Travel in Ecuador: A morning scene in Plaza San Francisco, Quito, Ecuador.

Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas</p><h2><strong>HOW TO GET TO ECUADOR</strong></h2><p>There are many other surprises that await travelers to Ecuador – and some handy ones at that: the U.S. dollar has been the official currency since 1999, and the electrical current is the same as in North America.</p><p>In just a few hours from many major airports in the U.S, you can be in a whole different world, or as the Ecuadorean tourism campaign quips, in “FOUR worlds in the middle of Planet Earth.”</p><p>It would be a shame to&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;visit the Galapagos, 600 miles off the coast, thus neglecting mainland Ecuador, as many do. Ecuador has four diverse and unique regions – the Amazon Rainforest, Highland Andes, the Coast and the Galapagos.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013, this small country (only about the size of Colorado or England,) won the World Travel Award’s World’s Leading Green Destination and was nominated in four additional categories at the international level.</p><p>Few places on earth offer such wide diversity of ethnicities, landscapes, cultural and historical heritage and nature, as well as adventure.</p><p>Indeed, this “land of eternal spring” received two of the first UNESCO World Heritage designations in 1978 – the only South American country to do so.</p><h2><strong>ECUADORIAN AMAZON RAINFOREST</strong></h2><p>The Ecuadorian Amazon Rainforest makes up 40 percent of the country’s territory and is home to 10 percent of the world’s known species, and is one of the most spectacular biodiversity regions on the planet.</p><p>Ecuador has 46 different ecosystems and is home to 62 percent of the total species of South America, including 1,695 bird species and a staggering 4,250 orchid species – with 19 percent of its territory designated protected areas.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2692.jpg\" alt=\"Cotopaxi Volcano in Ecuador peeking through the afternoon cloudbanks.

You’ll see your first view of Cotopaxi, the world’s highest active volcano, from its observatory.</p><h2><strong>WHAT TO SEE IN QUITO, ECUADOR</strong></h2><p>Founded in the 1500s, Quito is one of the best-preserved historic centers in the Americas, and is the highest official capital city in the world, at 9,350 feet.</p><p>With some 2,600,000 residents, Quito is surrounded by emerald-green mountains with misty cloud banks tucked between them, and on a clear day, the snow-capped Cotopaxi can be seen.</p><p>Quito has several world-class luxury hotels, as well as many more modest accommodations, gourmet dining, beautiful plazas and a dizzying number of exquisite churches, colonial-era mansions, and excellent museums.</p><h2><strong>WHAT IS THE WEATHER LIKE IN QUITO?</strong></h2><p>With its altitude and proximity to the equator, Quito has a year-round cool climate averaging in the ’50s and ’60s. There are two seasons, wet and dry – with the wettest time from October to May, which is true of much of the country.</p><p>Many tourists opt to begin their exploration in Quito. This colonial gem was named, along with Krakow, as one of the two first UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 1978.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2681-e1458596135997.jpg\" alt=\"The Ecuadorean highlands are misty, mysterious and magnificent.

Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas</p><p>Others choose to get into the Andes Highlands, or the cloud forest, or the Amazonia region.</p><p>Leaving Quito, one passes endless towering eucalyptus trees (an invasive species here,) grazing plump cattle, potato, bean and corn farms – a sea of shades of lush greens with purple mountains looming in the distance, cloud banks nestled between them.</p><h2><strong>LA VIRGEN CRUCE CORDILLERA MILESTONE</strong></h2><p>We arrived at the ‘Paramo’ (treeless Andes Highlands plateau) to begin a strenuous hike. Starting from the La Virgen Cruce Cordillera Milestone (13,123 feet,) we headed down winding, muddy trails, very grateful for the knee-high rubber boots we were given.</p><p>The landscape was mystical, reminding me somewhat of the moors in western Ireland. Indeed, the vegetation was spongy and very moist, with plants I had never seen before, and huge mist-covered lagoons reflected the sky in every direction.</p><p>We spotted three deer grazing between some rocks, and towards the end of the hike, were rewarded by our first view of Cotopaxi, resplendently emerging from the cloud bank with its snow-capped summit.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2694.jpg\" alt=\"The Termas de Papillacta spa and hot springs resort is a delightful, relaxing spot.

Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas</p><p>Thrilled, we then ended up at the biggest reward of all – a night of pampering at the Termas de Papillacta spa and hot springs resort.</p><p>What could be more perfect for sore muscles than a cozy, cabin-like room fronting a series of hot springs pools, heated by volcanic waters?</p><h2><strong>TROPICAL RAINFORESTS IN ECUADOR</strong></h2><p>Ecuador’s enormous tropical rainforest region is filled with rivers leading to the Amazon. The upper basin of the Amazon is richly biodiverse in this always hot and wet region, known as “Oriente” by the Ecuadorians. One can arrange visits to small Quechua-speaking communities which welcome guests for tours.</p><p>Fantastically lush with dense plants, flowers and animal life, this really felt like the jungle. We saw tarantulas, huge millipedes, frogs, orchids, 40-foot wide trees, Tarzan-type vines, and multicolored birds and yes, the experience was well worth sweating through. Miraculously, no one complained of mosquitoes.</p><p>There are many ecolodges and small inns in the jungle regions, but again, it is recommended to use a tour operator for your Ecuador adventure travel.</p><p>The so-called Avenue of the Volcanoes in the Andes Highlands was quite magical. We stayed at the El Porvenir Hacienda, owned by a supremely warm, gregarious Ecuadorian couple.</p><p>The hacienda has been in the family for 100 years and is beautifully restored and modernized. This working ranch is furnished with charming native handicrafts and plump, cozy chairs and sofas, with delightful bedrooms featuring lovely wrapped hot water bottles in every bed.</p><p>Maria and Jorge invite guests to take part in activities such as horseback riding, mountain biking, hiking, a ropes course and even cooking classes – delectable cheese empanadas and more.</p><p>We were immersed in the Ecuadorian “wild west,” replete with cattle branding, horseback riding and hearty, succulent meals of fresh-caught river trout with pesto and sirloin steak topped with local huckleberry sauce and toasted red onions.</p><p>Riders wear traditional wool striped ponchos and leather chaps, long goat hair and tooling adorning them.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2763.jpg\" alt=\"The author gets ready for her Highlands horseback ride at El Poremor.

Photo courtesy Irene Middleman Thomas</p><p>I felt like a local, trotting up the long grasses in the brisk 13,000 feet-high highlands wind, gazing at the pretty ground daisies, crocuses, asters and Andean Indian paintbrush. Cotopaxi peaked at us at times through the clouds – and when it did, everyone shrieked with excitement.</p><p>One way to travel between regions in style is with the historic&nbsp;<em>Tren Crucero</em>&nbsp;(tourist train,) which offers several touristic excursions on very comfortable trains with panoramic windows.</p><h2><strong>TREN CRUCERO</strong></h2><p>The newly-reopened&nbsp;<em>Tren Crucero</em>&nbsp;was named one of the world’s top five journeys by rail by Lonely Planet and also received accolades from the British Guild of Travel Writers, winning the Best Wider World Tourism Award.</p><p>On our trip from Bolillo to Machachi, I was charmed by the stream of village locals waving at us – it felt like we were in a parade. The trains are either new or recently refurbished and offer two classes of service, at very reasonable prices.</p><p>At our stop, a troupe of Ecuadorian dancers met us to put on a folkloric show – and when we reboarded, we were surprised by fresh fruit kabobs and tropical juices at our tables.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2820.jpg\" alt=\"Ecuadorian folkloric dancers perform for the Tren Crucero passengers. Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas\" height=\"500\" width=\"358\"></p><p>Ecuadorian folkloric dancers perform for the Tren Crucero passengers. Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas</p><p>One of the best places to enjoy Ecuador’s renowned bird watching is in the cloud forest. While there are several lesser-priced options in the region, if it’s in your budget, splurge on the Mashpi Lodge, a one-of-a-kind ecotourism property in the middle of nowhere, one of National Geographic’s Unique Lodges of the World.</p><p>I was highly impressed by the level of sophistication in the architecture, cuisine and accommodations that this property somehow brings about, flawlessly, many miles from the nearest village, let alone city.</p><p>With the only pedaled Sky Bike in the world (like a zipline but much better, soaring 180 feet high) a butterfly pavilion with full educational facilities, guided tours with experienced locals who have known the forest since childhood, waterfalls, rivers, birdwatching platforms – and truly gourmet cuisine to top it all off – Mashpi wins prize after prize. It’s a treasure.</p><p>Soft-spoken Jose Napa, one of the original guides, still shows his excitement when he spots birds. Touching my arm lightly, he led me in different directions to see toucans, collared trogans, and broad-billed motmots, watching my face to enjoy MY excitement.</p><h2><strong>WHAT IS THE CUISINE IN ECUADOR?</strong></h2><p>Cuisine in Ecuador ranges from rustic dishes dating from ancient times, such as various soups, including quinoa soup, ‘<em>choclo</em>,’ a potato and cheese soup topped with roasted corn and popcorn, yucca ‘<em>tortillas</em>,’ and ‘<em>maito</em>’ (tilapia or other fish, seasoned with lemon, salt, garlic and onion, wrapped in banana leaves and roasted) to sophisticated restaurants with multi-course meals worthy of New York, Paris or Buenos Aires.</p><p>You’ll try new fruits and vegetables, such as ‘tree tomatoes,’ with their delectable taste somehow in between oranges and tomatoes, and taxo, a type of passionfruit. Trout is abundant and delicious in Ecuador – prepared in many ways.</p><p>While Ecuador has excellent coffee, there are also many teas that are worth trying, some with medicinal or healing properties. Service is friendly, professional and quick – Ecuadorians expect that.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DSCF2777.jpg\" alt=\"A typical Ecuadorian stew with &quot;choclo&quot; - (popcorn).

Photo by Irene Middleman Thomas</p><p>As I strolled in one of Quito’s many plazas, with just two hours to spare until heading to the airport, a folkloric group of dancers put on an impromptu performance, reveling with swirling skirts and a brass band playing raucously.</p><p>Passersby stopped and before long, the performers reached out and grabbed spectators’ arms to join them. Letting loose in a 16th-century plaza with costumed dancers, under the moonlight shimmering on the cobblestones, I understood what they meant by ‘four worlds in one place.’</p><p>From cuisine to climate, to vegetation to culture, Ecuador is full of surprises.</p><h2><strong>IF YOU GO TO ECUADOR:</strong></h2><h2><strong>GETTING TO ECUADOR:&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Airlines flying to Quito include American, United, LAN Ecuador, Avianca, Copa and various others. Flight time from Fort Lauderdale/Miami to Quito is about 4 hours.</p><h2><strong>TOUR OPERATORS IN ECUADOR:</strong></h2><p>It is highly recommended to travel with a tour operator if venturing out of Quito or other urban areas. Roads are very mountainous and signage is not ideal, even for those fluent in Spanish. A good site for finding tour operators is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adventuretravel.biz/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>www.adventuretravel.biz</strong></a>.</p><h2><strong>WHEN TO GO TO ECUADOR:</strong></h2><p>Since Ecuador lies on the equator, it has no seasons. However, June, July and August are the driest months of the year, affording the best visibility of volcanoes – but they are also the windiest months.

After two years, the pandemic was seriously frustrating me and I was in desperate need of exploring another country. Until then, I covered a lot of places already.</p><p>65 countries to be specific. “Where should I go next?” I asked myself and found a quick answer to this question while looking at the “countries been” app on my phone.</p><p>Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina was the obvious choice. But why did I choose this country? What is unique about it? Let me take you on a little journey to a very specific place in the remote and isolated northern part of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. A journey I took only to get one particular picture.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/View-of-river-with-abandoned-building.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg\" alt=\"View of river with abandoned building.

On top of that, Bosnia is relatively cheap, making it a perfect destination for an affordable getaway.</p><p>However, what attracted me the most was one specific landmark. A place in nature that looked so stunning in pictures that I just had to get there myself: Vodopad Blihe (called Blihin Skok by locals).</p><p>This waterfall drops about 56 meters (183 feet) and lies in a hidden valley close to the northwestern border to Croatia. Once I discovered this natural beauty during my research online, both my flight and rental car were booked in no time.</p><p>Only three days later, in the beginning of March 2022, my journey started in a small city called Banja Luka, about 3 hours north of Bosnia’s capitol Sarajevo. The first hour, I found myself driving on the M4 west towards a town called Prijedor. Basically, you could say there was not much to see throughout the entire drive.</p><p><img src=\"../uploads/Empty-trail-entrance-area.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg\"></p><p>Empty trail entrance area.

There were dozens of abandoned buildings and ruins left from the war in every town I passed through.</p><p>All of them were easily accessible and right in front of me. No detour is needed. Just parking the car for a couple of minutes was enough to snap some great pictures.</p><p>The cold and cloudy winter day complemented the already depressed feeling about those places as I walked through them. Once again, just like during many of my previous journeys, I found myself wondering how people could live here.</p><p>Time seemed to have stopped a long time ago. No people out in the streets, no restaurants, no entertainment. Just lots of trash and a few stray dogs crossing the street every once in a while.</p><p>From Prijedor, I continued on the R405 southwest towards Donji Kamengrad and further towards Fajtovci. The GPS was set to the waterfall (“Vodopad Blihe”) and led me right into nowhere. “You have reached your destination” a friendly voice told me. Obviously not.</p><p><img src=\"../uploads/Vodopad-Blihe-street-sign.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg\"></p><p>Vodopad Blihe street sign. Photo by Thomas Später</p><h2><strong>TURNED AROUND FOR VODOPAD BLIHE</strong></h2><p>Once I turned around and drove back a few minutes, I saw a bright yellow “Vodopad Blihe” sign right on the side of the street. Seems like I had simply overlooked it. “Sometimes, paying more attention to the road than to the GPS sure wouldn’t hurt” I thought.&nbsp;</p><p>After I followed the designated road for 2 additional minutes, I reached a small wooden information booth, a playground and a tent that served as a restaurant (by the way, setting the GPS to “Bistro Vodopad Blihe” instead of only “Vodopad Blihe” would have brought me here correctly). Of course, everything was closed and not a single person to be found anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like during the past 30 minutes of my journey, that was precisely what I was hoping for. I personally find a strong correlation between off-season traveling and the happiness level of my experiences in nature.</p><p>The fewer people, the happier I am. Not just because of my photography, but in general. I feel emotionally thrilled when I am as alone as possible in nature.</p><p>And right then, I was the only person inside the entire nature preserve area. I decided to park the car close by a tree below the playground and started to make my way down towards what seemed to be the right direction.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Trail-entrance.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg\" alt=\"Trail entrance. Photo by Thomas Später \" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Trail entrance. Photo by Thomas Später</p><p>It was cold and started to rain/snow right when I took my first steps on the wooden path. I had to be extra careful, since the slippery ground made it not easy to move forward without almost falling. After a few minutes, the wooden steps turned into an actual hiking trail and then back into a wooden track that led to a little shelter.</p><p>I used this stop to prepare my tripod, drone and camera lenses. According to the GPS, I was right in front of the waterfall but yet couldn’t see it. Neither could I hear it over the wind and rain at this point.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I felt prepared enough, I continued my walk for only 30 more seconds and suddenly saw the waterfall behind a slight little right turn. It was majestic, beautiful and overwhelming.</p><p>Much bigger than it looked in any of the pictures I found online and way more impressive than I ever imagined it could be. At the end of the wooden path, I reached a small platform that served as a lookout point.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Trail.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg\" alt=\"Trail. Photo by Thomas Später \" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Trail. Photo by Thomas Später</p><h2><strong>CAPTURING VODOPAD BLIHE</strong></h2><p>It was open towards the front, so people can walk as close to the waterfall as they like. Easier said than done. The force of the water dropping into the pond in front of me created so much wind and water mist that I had a tough time walking much closer. The muddy and slippery ground contributed to the tricky endeavor.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I even finished thinking about what lens and camera angle I should go for, my entire equipment, including myself, was completely wet. At this point, I was highly demotivated.</p><p>There was one specific picture I wanted. I knew exactly how I wanted it to look but couldn’t figure out how to execute the task in this harsh environment.</p><p>It almost seemed impossible to position the tripod far enough from the waterfall to avoid the mist getting the camera wet, but close enough so I could safely make it to my desired position within the 10-second camera timer. All of it without hurting myself by sipping off wet rocks while running of course.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as I was about to give up and leave with “only” some waterfall pictures, the wind in the valley changed in a way that it pushed against the mist coming from the waterfall. This was my time window. I set up everything again in a few seconds and managed to take my shot.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Wet-equipment.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg\" alt=\"Wet equipment. Photo by Thomas Später \" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Wet equipment. Photo by Thomas Später</p><h2><strong>OFF THE GRID</strong></h2><p>After double-checking the picture’s quality, I packed up my gear and moved back a few steps to sit down inside the small shelter I had passed earlier. For about an hour, I just sat there.</p><p>Sure, it was cold and wet, but this is always what I love most after all. After all the effort finding places, after the preparation and picture taking, after all the stress, the siting down and taking in nature is what I love the most. ‘</p><p>No cell phone, no camera, no drone. Just nature and me. After about an hour it started to get dark in the valley, so I slowly got up, moved up the wooden path and made my way back to Banja Luka.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are into nature and landscapes, this country definitely deserves a place on your bucket list. Particularly because Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina is not yet very developed for tourism (yet!), there are numerous opportunities to experience untouched landscapes without hundreds of other visitors.</p><p>If you are willing to deal with a colder environment and walk that extra mile, off-season gets you an even better chance of true isolation. However, no matter where you will end up exactly within Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, you should definitely make Vodopad Blihe a mandatory stop.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drone-shot-of-waterfall.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1.jpg\" alt=\"Drone shot of waterfall.

If you are already in Europe, I highly recommend booking budget flights with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ryanair.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>RyanAir</strong></a>.</p><p>This Airline is generally connected to Banja Luka, a small city in northern Bosnia. Although this place has not much to offer, it is only about 2 hours away from the waterfall.</p><p>If this flight connection is not possible, you have to drive about 5 hours from Sarajevo. As for hotels in Banja Luka, you can easily find many options on common websites, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://booking.tp.st/mZw9q6Nw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>booking.com</strong></a>.</p><p>However, I highly recommend staying in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hotelviktorija.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Hotel Vila Viktoria</strong></a>. Considering the general condition of the country, this place has quite nice rooms and collaborates with a good restaurant right next door (where also breakfast is served).&nbsp;</p>', 7, 4, '2023-05-31 13:17:20', 'tourism', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/View-of-river-with-abandoned-building.-Photo-by-Thomas-Spater-1-edited.jpg');

(25, 'A TASTE OF THINGS TO DO IN PORTO, PORTUGAL: PORT WINE IS JUST THE BEGINNING', '<p>ust a few hours up the coast from Lisbon by comfortable high-speed train, a taste of Porto awaits. It was here that my family and I&nbsp;had a few days to enjoy the local life.</p><p>Located about 200 miles north of Lisbon, Porto is a more laid-back and smaller version of the nation’s capital city. The hills were certainly there but did not seem quite as steep. The Douro River—a bloodline for Spain and Portugal—flowed through the city and into the Atlantic.</p><p>Amazing architecture abounds, and the port wine was ever-present. Tourists were present as well, but there were fewer here than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/things-to-do-in-lisbon-portugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>in Lisbon</strong></a>. As a result, lines were shorter, sites were less crowded and the streets and squares seemed more populated by locals than tourists. Furthermore, Porto was walkable at a leisurely pace.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Porto-Train-Station.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Tiled Train Station\" height=\"562\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Sao Bento Train Station. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><p>Founded in 417, Porto has seen several rulers and owners. However, the Douro River, flowing into the Atlantic has always been a part of Porto life.</p><p>Much like Lisbon, Porto benefited from Portugal’s age of discovery and the resulting spice trade of the 15th&nbsp;and 16th&nbsp;centuries. After that, port wine became the city’s new lifeline and is still a huge industry today.</p><p>Our temporary home in Porto,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/portugal-holiday/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Portugal</strong></a>&nbsp;was Cetu Terrace Suites, an apartment, just north of the Cathedral District.&nbsp;We were about a two-minute walk from the busy Parca de Liberdade (Liberty Square), a busy gathering place lined with stately buildings.</p><p>The apartment was clean and comfortable, with a Nespresso machine in the room for an any-time-of-day espresso. Made-to-order breakfast and a buffet overlooking a city view were included.</p><p>The best part of our flat, however, was being able to walk to everything. A stroll north of us took us to local neighborhoods which were tourist-free. Here we could explore the grocery store, shops, cafes and restaurants that the locals visit, if with a bit of a language barrier challenge.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Portugal.jpg\" alt=\"Porto is known for creating delicious Port wine but that is just the beginning of the beautiful sights and things to do in Porto, Portugal. #portoportugal #portugaltravel\" height=\"750\" width=\"500\"></p><h2><strong>DECIPHERING THE MENU</strong></h2><p>For our first culinary adventure, we found a place where locals were lined up to eat. We secured a table in the crowded little restaurant that reminded me of some of the tavernas we’d visited in Italy. The food was good. The caveat: they did not speak English and did not have a menu in English.</p><p>Thankfully,&nbsp;we were able to figure out what we wanted using our phrase book. However, when we went to place our order, we were told it wasn’t possible.</p><p>“<em>No, no, no,</em>” the waiter said dismissively. “<em>Not today.</em>” He turned the page of our typed Portuguese menus. “<em>Esta. This.</em>”</p><p>We came to understand that we could only order off certain pages on certain days. It took us a little more time, but we finally figured out that what we had originally wanted was also on these pages. But in different forms or portions.</p><p>We enjoyed the uncomplimentary bread and olives as we waited. Then moved on to green vegetable soup, salmon steak, pork rounds and seafood stew. It was all delicious and paired well with some dry, red Portuguese wine.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Porto-McDonalds.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Porto McDonalds\" height=\"562\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Porto McDonalds. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MCDONALD’S IN THE WORLD?</strong></h2><p>“<em>Look, it’s Garrett,”&nbsp;</em>Alex said as we strolled through Liberty Square. He made the reference because of a friend back home by the same name. At the square’s northern end, just in front of the large City Hall, a monument honored the writer Almeida Garrett. They were also a poet, playwright, novelist, journalist and politician.</p><p>Walking from Liberty Square to Parca de Almeida Garrett, we stopped in an American restaurant. A place we typically avoid during visits to other countries.</p><p>“<em>Nobody said McDonald’s,</em>” I admitted, “<em>but let’s take a break today.</em>”</p><p>I’ll admit that we did not place an order as we had already enjoyed some local cuisine. However, we could see why this McDonald’s is often called the most beautiful McDonald’s in the world. It opened in 1995, in what used to be a famous coffee shop called Café Imperial.</p><p>The dining space dates to the 1930s, with stained glass windows by Portuguese artist Ricardo Leone. There were also crystal chandeliers, friezes designed by Moreira and an enormous bronze eagle perched atop a metal “McDonald’s” sign.</p><p>The most beautiful in the world? Perhaps. Although I remember visiting the McDonalds in Moscow back in the early 1990s and being stunned by the mosaic decorations and full decorative fountain inside.</p><p>You could tell the tourists from the locals by who was focused on the food and who was focused on the scenery. As we left, we saw the restaurant’s most enthusiastic customers—a trio of pigeons—feasting on fries on an outdoor table.</p><h2><strong>ILED TRAIN STATION</strong></h2><p>Although the monument to the great writer is in Liberty Square, there is an entire square named for Almeida Garrett just a short stroll from his monument. As we stood in the square looking around us, the diversity of the surrounding architecture was marvelous.</p><p>It included art deco and modern, gothic and arabesque, neoclassical and rococo. But the most impressive building here was the old Sao Bento Train Station.</p><p>The station still operates today, but this is a destination and not a portal for most of the visitors when we were there. People come to view the elaborate tile pictures in the main lobby. The tiled interior depicts modes of transportation and historic and festive scenes in huge tile murals that take up entire walls.</p><p>From the front balcony of the train station, we stopped and took another long look at the cityscape. This was our gateway into the Cathedral District. But first, a tower beckoned in the distance.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Church-of-the-Clergyman.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Church of the Clergyman\" height=\"666\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Church of the Clergyman. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>CLERICS AND CLERGYMEN</strong></h2><p>About a ten-minute walk from Sao Bento Train Station stands the Tower of Clerics.&nbsp;It is one of the tallest buildings in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/aveiro-portugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Portugal</strong></a>&nbsp;and is made to seem even taller due to its hilltop location. Perhaps more amazing than its status is that it was built in the 18th&nbsp;century, before the modern age of sky-piercing buildings.</p><p>Climbing the 240 steps was a chore. But it paid off in scenic dividends with a view of Douro valley, river, coastline and city skyline.</p><p>The adjoining baroque Church of the Clergymen is also well worth a visit. Inside, we were surprised at some of the views offered, not only through the windows out but also the ones within.</p><p>The church also contains a museum that includes relics, artifacts, sculptures, paintings and jewelry. One room was filled with dozens of crucifix carvings and depictions. Another featured modern religious sketches and art.</p><p>After standing in the church and looking up at the altar, featuring an enormous scene of the crucifixion, we found ourselves upstairs, looking down from above the alter at the people looking up. It gave the impression of seeing the church from the crucified’s point of view.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Se-de-Porto-Porto-Cathedral-canva.jpg\" alt=\"Se do Porto (Porto Cathedral) \" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Se do Porto (Porto Cathedral)</p><h2><strong>OH, SE CAN YOU SEE?</strong></h2><p>Many visitors come to Porto,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/6-must-see-places-portugal-you-cant-miss/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Portugal</strong></a>&nbsp;for the riverfront area. That certainly was an enjoyable distraction. But for us, the most interesting place to explore in Porto was the Cathedral District.</p><p>At the center is Se, or Porto Cathedral. Built in the 12th&nbsp;and 13th&nbsp;centuries, the massive fortress has been modified several times, now boasting a baroque portal. A striking, 13th-century rose window of stained glass lights up the darkened interior. The gothic cloisters are lined with tile and the courtyard features a stone fountain.</p><p>Terreiro da Se, a small square next to Se, features a Manueline pillory, as well as a great view of the city. And just next door, along the square, is the Episcopal Palace, or Bishop’s Palace, once home to the city’s bishops.</p><p>The museum within the baroque and rococo Bishop’s Palace is certainly worth a visit and was part of a combined ticket with the cathedral. Inside the palace are a beautiful grand staircase, domed ceiling, artwork, decorative tiles, antique furniture and decorative arts. The museum was a great supplement to the cathedral visit.</p><p>Just around the corner from the Bishop’s Palace and down a curving street, is Casa-Museu Guerra Junqueiro. This little museum is in the former home of the poet. He was a collector of ceramics, tapestries and curiosities, all of which are on display.</p><p>The collection was nice, but nicer still are the Portuguese poet’s words inscribed on his home’s wall:</p><p><em>“Upon the jagged leaf of a sycamore tree,</em></p><p><em>Which, like a scavenger, on stones and lava feeds,</em></p><p><em>The gentle Dawn, compassionate and divine,</em></p><p><em>Shed an ethereal tear, huge and crystalline.</em></p><p><em>So perfect and so limpid a tear that it appeared</em></p><p><em>From afar, a star, a diamond, when neared.</em></p><p><em>With his splendid retinue, a king passed that way,</em></p><p><em>Helmets, spears, bugles, thirty banners on display.</em></p><p><em>“My crown,” exclaimed the king, surveying the scene,</em></p><p><em>“Contains countless sapphires and gemstones that gleam,</em></p><p><em>Exquisite rubies of blood-red and gold,</em></p><p><em>Crystallized kisses of love set aglow.</em></p><p><em>There are pearl which are drops of immense agony,</em></p><p><em>Shed as tears by the Moon, frozen hard by the sea.</em></p><p><em>Yet diamonds and rubies and pearls from Ophir,</em></p><p><em>All this I’d forsake just to have you, oh tear.”</em></p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Interior-of-Santa-Clara-Mannerist-Church.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of Santa Clara Mannerist Church\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Interior of Santa Clara Mannerist Church</p><h2><strong>DON’T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER</strong></h2><p>We had heard good things about Santa Clara Mannerist Church, a bit off the beaten path but still within the Cathedral District. We actually passed right by it more than once, wondering where it could be. Its modest exterior is hidden between a police station and a parking lot, behind a courtyard wall.</p><p>“<em>Maybe this is it,</em>” Nataliya said, pointing to an open doorway in the wall.</p><p>We entered the modest doorway to an even more modest courtyard. To the left, policemen walked in and out of a doorway. To the right, a glass door was surrounded by a stone façade with spiral columns and statuary. Sure enough, this was the entrance to the most remarkable interior in Porto.</p><p>Inside, Santa Clara’s walls, ceilings, altarpieces and chapels were covered in gold. The interior appears to be wood and stone. However, a historian pointed out that it is all carved wood, and the few areas that are not covered in gold are painted to look like stone and alabaster.</p><p>“I can prove it,” the historian said, requesting that we follow him to the upper level. There, he showed us an upper room that overlooked the church’s gilded interior. Here were individually carved benches, each with a face, animal, or another symbol of the seat’s owner carved upon it. There were also not-yet-restored altarpieces on display.</p><p>“<em>Do you see the damage?</em>” he asked “<em>The entire church was infested with and damaged by termites. That is why we only reopened last year after being closed for five years of restoration.</em>”</p><p>Indeed, the bare woodwork on the second floor was ridden with holes where termites had eaten away at the wood. After seeing the opulent interior below, it was hard to believe that it had been termite-damaged as well. Now, it looked perfect.</p><p>Once he saw that we were interested, the historian remained with us, joining us as we returned to the golden interior below for a closer look. The church was built in the early 1400s but was rebuilt several times.</p><p>The historian cracked a smile. “<em>Santa Clara is the patron saint of good weather, so you can thank your pilgrimage to us here for the good weather we’re having today.</em>”</p><p>The front altar and two long side walls of the church were covered in statuary, cherubs, angles, saints and decorations carved of wood.</p><p>“<em>Santa Clara is the only church in Portugal that prominently features statues of two black saints,</em>” he pointed out.</p><p>In one carving, Saint Francis of Assisi stands in purgatory, above the fires of hell and below Christ in heaven. Two women reach up from the flames to hold the bottom of his robe.</p><p>“<em>He wants to go to heaven,</em>” the historian said with a chuckle. “<em>But, of course, he cannot resist the touch of women.</em>”</p><p>I looked around at the gold-covered interior. “<em>If this is what purgatory looks like, it’s not so bad.</em>”</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Bolsa-Palace-canva.jpg\" alt=\" Bolsa Palace \" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Bolsa Palace</p><h2><strong>WORSHIP AND WEALTH</strong></h2><p>Leaving the Cathedral District does not mean leaving behind impressive churches. And St. Francis seems to have more than one gold-encrusted home in the city of Porto. Closer to the river, the gothic church of Sao Francisco was built in the 1300s. Its baroque interior is covered in more than 450 pounds of gold, primarily on the high altar, columns and pillars.</p><p>The church features catacombs and a vault of religious treasures. But, its highlight, on display in the center of one of the interior walls, is the Tree of Jesse, depicting the family tree of Jesus. Jesse is within the roots of the literal tree, with King David and Solomon in the lower branches.</p><p>Extending up the tree is Mary on one side and Joseph on the other. Jesus stands at the top of the tree. The entire tree is carved from wood. It was painted and gilded in the early 1700s.</p><p>Porto citizens of means worshipped wealth as well. As a testament to that other sort of worship stands Bolsa Palace, an old Commerce Palace that still operates as a chamber of commerce.</p><p>The guided tour of Bolsa Palace took us through the history of Porto’s commerce while showcasing the building’s impressive rooms.</p><p>Frescoes, tiled floors and ornate plasterwork decorate room after room throughout the palace. One room featured paintings of all the Chamber of Commerce presidents through the ages. Another room appeared to be made entirely of decorative dark wood but is actually painted plaster.</p><p>The crown of the palace is the Arabesque Room. Here are beautiful arabesque plaster, arches, domes and windows. It reminded me of the mosques of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. This is the room where they host diplomats and prime ministers.</p><p>In fact, the day prior to our visit, Bolsa Palace hosted an eastern European prime minister. The red carpet was still on the staircase from that visit. We took the far staircase but were sure to walk across that red carpet on the way.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Riverfront-canva.jpg\" alt=\"Porto Riverfront\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Porto Riverfront</p><h2><strong>DOWN BY THE RIVER</strong></h2><p>Ribeira, Porto’s riverfront quarter, features twisted streets and arcades. Here you can find quaint hole-in-the-wall cafes, laundry hanging in the wind from upstairs apartment windows and shops that sell everything from groceries to cell phones to textiles.</p><p>We stopped in at a little yellow-awninged café for sandwiches and Super Bock beer (the number one choice in Portugal) to tide us over until dinner. Also, to fortify us for some fortified wine across the river.</p><p>Down at the side of the Douro River, the vibe becomes like that of a popular boardwalk. There are bustling outdoor restaurants serving food and drink plus crowds sitting on benches and strolling along the riverside. Bustling as the old city side of the river is, we preferred the less crowded far side. There we could find cafes, restaurants, street vendors, wine caves and port wine tastings.</p><p>There are ferries and boats that will take you from the north side of the river to the south and vice versa. But we opted to take the most scenic route—across the Luis I Bridge.</p><p>You can cross the bridge along the lower level, but more interesting is the top level, where it’s mostly foot traffic with an occasional tram running across the center. The Luis I Bridge was built in 1886 by an apprentice of Gustave Eiffel and is one of the most recognizable landmarks of the city.</p><p>The south side of the Douro is less crowded, but there are still plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shops to occupy your time.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Bacalhau-canva.jpg\" alt=\"Things to do in Porto Portugal\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Traditional Portugeuse Bolinho de Bacalhau (cod fish croquettes)</p><h2><strong>SOMETHING WACKY THIS WAY COMES</strong></h2><p>Although a bit on the touristy side, Casa Portuguesa do Pastel de Bacalhau is worth a pop in. You’ll most certainly be walking past it if you’re on that side of the river.</p><p>The establishment manages to be stately, quirky and radiates a circus vibe all at once. As you walk along the river, you’ll know it when you hear the carnival-like organ music playing.</p><p>Walk in, and you’ll see an enormous library stocked full of antique books so high you may need to climb the rolling ladder to find the one you want. And if you’d like to relax on a leather bench to read, you’re welcome to do so.</p><p>For about 15 euros, you can order a glass of port and a traditional cheese-filled cod and potato cutlet made in front of you. The cheese comes from their sheep farm. Take a walk up the spiral staircase for a display of older port wines.</p><p>Then take a seat upstairs or downstairs to watch the live organ concert—more carnival than cathedral. When we were there, the organist was in absolute ABBA mode. We would have preferred Fado or the soft Portuguese pop we’d heard in the nearby market.</p><p>Despite the enormous and beautiful library, decked-out staff, ironwork spiral staircases and beautiful organ, it somehow has a freaky carnival feel to it.</p><p>“This looks like something that would be in&nbsp;<em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>,” my son said. After the spectacle, you get to keep your port wine glass to remember the experience.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Port-Tasting.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Port Tasting. \" height=\"562\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Port Tasting. Photo by Eric D. Goodman</p><h2><strong>THE PORT IN PORTO</strong></h2><p>The egg-sized cod, potato and cheese cutlet wasn’t enough to make a meal, so we headed to one of the many restaurants along the south side of the river.</p><p>Unless you’re a vegetarian, a visit to Porto isn’t complete without trying their famous Franceshina sandwich. It is made of bread, cured ham, fresh sausage, steak and other roast meat.</p><p>Then it’s all covered with melted cheese and swims in a pool of hot spiced tomato and beer sauce and topped off with a fried egg. You may want to consult your doctor before trying one. It goes well with Super Bock or Portuguese Green Wine.</p><p>Fortified by a full meal, we were ready to sample Porto’s most famous export: port wine. In the same way that cognac and champagne only come from France, true port wine only comes from the Douro region.</p><p>Dozens of wine caves, cafes and restaurants offer port wine tastings where you can sample a number of them all in one sitting. We opted for an outdoor riverside café that allowed us to watch the river activity across the way as we slowly sipped our wines.</p><p>We were surprised at how generous the portions were. Each of us sampled five different types of port—red, white, rose, tawny and ruby. We also snacked&nbsp;a light cheese and meat platter. The glasses lined up like a sticky rainbow in the sun.</p><p>“<em>To the port in Porto,</em>” I toasted with a ruby.</p><p>“<em>And everything else in Porto, too,</em>” Nataliya added.</p><p>Our days in Portugal’s second-largest city, from gold-filled churches to richly decorated palaces, cobblestone walks to riverside strolls, were coming to a close.

High-speed trains from Lisbon to Porto are inexpensive—we paid less than $50 per ticket each way.</p><p>The trip takes about three hours. An internet search for Lisbon-Porto train tickets will give you a variety of options. You can also brave the station and buy your tickets there easily enough.</p><p>Porto has public transportation and taxis are inexpensive, especially if there are two or more people getting in. But we found the entire city walkable. The best way to discover not only the tourist sights but also the everyday life in a place like Porto is to walk from place to place.</p><p>Along the way take in the sights of hanging laundry, people playing cards in parks and carrying their groceries through the pedestrian streets. Having GPS on your phone helps, but old-fashioned maps still come in handy.</p><p>We stayed at Cetu Terrace Suites. You can find accommodations on sites like AirBnb or Booking.com. We prefer flats to hotels oftentimes; this was sort of in between and recommended.&nbsp;</p>', 15, 4, '2023-05-31 13:19:14', 'international', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Porto-Porto-Train-Station.-Photo-by-Eric-D.-Goodman-1-of-1.jpg'),

Even if I have no plans coming up and am cash-strapped from the last trip, it is still interesting to understand the world from locals or first-hand experience, though I’ve found capitals have always been the lamest part of any trip.</p><p>I have come across a hundred posts mentioning how it is a waste of time to visit the country’s capital and it is not even worth a day.</p><p>Mostly, it is understood that there is not much to see other than huge skyscraper extravaganza or the bustling city traffic.

From mosques and churches, synagogues, fun&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/cairo-travel-market/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Egyptian markets</strong></a>, royal palaces to museums, you name it. Not to mention the authentic Egyptian cuisine.</p><p>As it is never boring for me to tour around Cairo, here is a list of fun stops I have compiled to visit especially if you have a thing for photography or just want to live the genuine vibe.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cairo-bird.jpg\" alt=\"The Nile River in Cairo\" height=\"523\" width=\"750\"></p><p>The Nile River in Cairo.

In credits to its construction site, being on one of the highest points of Cairo, you can feel the powerful fit it has. In addition to that, the breeze in this area is a lifesaver on a hot, summery morning.</p><p>Many interesting sights are in the citadel, which gives you a variety of options, making it a whole lot for a one-day visit but nevertheless, a diverse one.</p><p>These spots include some of the very prominent landmarks in Cairo, such as Masjid Muhammad Ali Pasha, Ottoman-era Sulayman Pasha al-Khadim Masjid. Also, a few other museums can be checked off your list such as Police Museum, the Royal Vehicle Museum, and the Military Museum.</p><p>Entry to the citadel is granted every day from 9:00 am till 5:00 pm, however, entry fees are different for foreign travelers.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/muhammad.jpg\" alt=\"Mosque of Muhammad Ali, Cairo, Egypt\" height=\"677\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Mosque of Muhammad Ali, Cairo, Egypt. Photo by Nada Elkoshairy</p><h2><strong>MOSQUE MUHAMMAD ALI PASHA</strong></h2><p>This marvelous mosque is an absolute favorite, with everything so grand and vast, I highly doubt you will be feeling anything but imminent grace. Everything is marbled, with huge assisting columns and beautifully carpeted floors, a photographer’s haven.</p><p>The ceiling is decorated in intricate details and dangled with hundreds of lanterns coordinated in circulars. The outside area is equally graceful, it’s completely tiled in white marble paneling and a sunset in there is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p><p>As one of the prominent installments in Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi Citadel, the Alabaster Mosque was built by no other than Muhammad Ali Pasha. The Mosque includes a twin minaret, considered to be the highest in all of Egypt.</p><p>The open court area of the mosque features a copper clock tower that was gifted by Louis Phillippe of France in 1262 AH/1845 AD and Muhammad Ali responded to this gesture by Ramsses II’s obelisk that can be seen in the Place de La Concorde Square, Paris.</p><p>You can have a completely free visit to the mosque every day through hours from 8:00 am until 3:00 pm. However, make sure to wear conservative clothes to be granted access. Usually, women cover from head to toe while visiting mosques.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/muhammad-palace.jpg\" alt=\"The Intricacies of Muhammad Ali Mosque.\" height=\"667\" width=\"500\"></p><p>The Intricacies of Muhammad Ali Mosque. Photo by Nada Elkoshairy</p><h2><strong>MUHAMMAD ALI PALACE</strong></h2><p>With a reign that lasted 43 years, Muhammad Ali’s time contributed a lot to the state welfare and the powerfulness of the country. And of course, a Sultan typically comes with his own palace, no less than an extravagant mix of multi-cultured styles.</p><p>Established in Al-Manial, it is given a huge significance with credit to its architectural vibe. Composed of the Islamic style, it is well mixed with the vibrancy of Mamluk and Persian features, in addition to the influence of Andalusian, Syrian and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/top-destinations-for-millennial-travelers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Moroccan</strong></a>&nbsp;motives.</p><p>The palace includes a clock tower, reception hall, throne hall, a hunting museum and plenty more to offer for a good day visit.</p><p>The multiple styles were a new experience for me, overwhelming to be precise. I can confidently say that it felt like being transferred to a different world, experiencing various cultures all at once. The feeling of richness and vast splendor of this palace is unmatchable.</p><p>Visiting hours are from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm but beware that the ticketing window issues the last ticket by 2:15 pm, with different ticket prices for foreign visitors.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/palace.jpg\" alt=\"Muhammad Ali Palace, Cairo, Egypt.

This area of Cairo has been recognized as one of Egypt’s seven UNESCO World Heritage.</p><p>The history of Khan al-Khalili dates back to the fourteenth century, the then Master of Stables, Jaharkas El Khalili built a caravanserai (Colloquially referred to as&nbsp;<em>Khan</em>) that initially provided housing for merchants, and during the years, other sultans contributed to the area and added their own khans making the puzzle complete and establishing an area that later on became the center of trade by the late fifteenth century.</p><p><br></p><p>Think of Khan el-Khalili as a labyrinth of all things mystical and whimsical, you can go around in circles and find new things each time you turn. From gold jewelry and silver pharaonic replica pendants to mosaic lanterns and plenty of little souvenirs, you can find a variety of things in a huge price range.</p><p>It’s the best place to feel the authentic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/5-must-see-locations-egypt/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Cairo</strong></a>&nbsp;vibes, at least in my opinion, the noise and crowd is something you can never escape, but an enticing experience.</p><p>With plenty of colors and music everywhere, the scent of coffee wafting through the air and the sound of hookah cackling make the best market day.</p><p>While you are there, this is definitely a place to practice your bargaining and haggling skills, and I add, relentlessly. You will always get a good offer at the end of the day.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hanging-church.jpg\" alt=\"The Hanging Church, Cairo, Egypt CC Image by Nada Elkoshairy\" height=\"667\" width=\"500\"></p><p>The Hanging Church, Cairo, Egypt. Photo by Nada Elkoshairy</p><h2><strong>CAIRO’S RELIGIOUS COMPLEX</strong></h2><p>If you are looking for one place that has three monotheistic religions, then go no further than Cairo’s Religious Complex. With Amr Ibn Al-Aas Mosque, The Hanging Church and Ben Ezra Synagogue, this is exactly where it got its significance from.</p><p>Standing as the second mosque built in Egypt, with construction dating back to the year 21 AH, Amr Ibn Al-Aas Mosque is recognized as the largest and oldest mosque in Africa. As of the date of its construction, it was mainly built using palm tree trunks, mud bricks and gravel, which was later transformed into marble columns and tiles.</p><p>Amr Ibn Al-Aas Mosque is free of charge for visitors all week long with no specific hours, however, it’s better to visit during the early hours of the morning.</p><p>The Hanging Church was built over the Roman fortress of Babylon, towering over most of the surrounding buildings, hence the name.</p><p>Throughout its history, it was the seat of many patriarchs, when Patriarch Christozoulos made The Hanging church the seat of the Pope of Alexandria. It was also recognized as the place where The Holy Family took shelter from Herod, the King of Palestine.</p><p>Visiting The Hanging Church is free of charge for all visitors.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cairo-nile.jpg\" alt=\"Overlooking Cairo in Egypt. \" height=\"375\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Overlooking Cairo in Egypt. Photo Credit</p><h2><strong>TRAVEL TO CAIRO</strong></h2><p>While Islam and Christianity were represented in this area, Judaism had also its very own representation. Ben Ezra Synagogue is of the oldest Judaism temples founded in the lands of Egypt.</p><p>Its significance came from a few stories, where it is believed to preserve the basket Prophet Moses was placed in and it is also where Prophet Moses prayed to God when the plague hit Egypt. The temple was named after the head of The Jewish community, Abraham bin Ezra.</p><p>The Religious complex does not end there, while it includes these fascinating spots, it also houses The Coptic Museum, Abi Sarjah Church, St. Margirus’s Monastery and the Church of Saint Barbara.</p><p>That is how you barely scratch the surface of what Cairo has to offer and to get to everything there is, it would take a whole book worth of everything to visit. With that being said, I would say Cairo definitely deserves a lot more than just two days on a sprint.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/coptic.jpg\" alt=\"Strolling through Coptic Cairo.

English and Sign Language are self-explanatory, but there is a lot of confusion around Scots and Gaelic which are two very different languages.</p><p>Historically, there has been a split between the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/dublin-l31/dublin-gaelic-games-experience-t217770/?partner_id=G1S2ECT&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher&amp;placement=content-middle&amp;cmp=lowlands-gaelic&amp;deeplink_id=98504a23-7931-5be6-93f4-49f24509ab4a\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>Gaelic speaking</em></strong></a>&nbsp;Highlands and the Scots speaking Lowlands. Many people visiting Scotland put in a lot of effort to learn a few Gaelic phrases, not realising that only around 1% of the population will understand them.</p><p>At one time, Scotland would have been full of Gaelic speakers but that has retreated to primarily the islands and far-flung corners of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/real-scotland-traveling-history-rich-highlands/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>the Highlands</strong></a>. The language is now making a definite resurgence, helped along by shows like Outlander.</p><p>What you will hear many people in Scotland speaking isn’t just English with a funny accent like some would have you believe. It’s an equally historic and underappreciated language called Scots.</p><p>With the same root as English, most words are the same or similar so easy enough to understand if you can get past the accents. If you don’t understand, then just let the person know and they’ll often be happy to speak a bit slower.</p><p>A few examples of Scots words are&nbsp;<em>dreich</em>&nbsp;for drizzly rain,&nbsp;<em>loch</em>&nbsp;for lake,&nbsp;<em>braw</em>&nbsp;for good and&nbsp;<em>dinnae ken</em>&nbsp;for don’t know.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Castle-Sween.jpg\" alt=\"Castle Sween\" height=\"667\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Castle Sween.&nbsp;Photo by Graeme Johncock</p><h2><strong>TRAVELLING INSIDE SCOTLAND</strong></h2><p>You will quickly find when visiting Scotland that just because somewhere looks close on a map, that doesn’t mean the journey will be short. Off the motorways, many roads quickly become narrower and more winding. Once you reach the Highlands and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/scotland-the-isles-of-mull-and-iona/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Scottish Islands</strong></a>, expect to drive on single track roads.</p><p>Special care needs taken on these roads with only space for one car at a time and lots of blind corners. There is a strict etiquette here and if it isn’t followed then local residents can get very annoyed.</p><p>f another vehicle is coming the other way, just pull into the nearest passing place and wait patiently. The same applies if you are driving slowly to appreciate the scenery and another car is stuck behind you.</p><p>That doesn’t mean you should just stick to public transport and avoid driving altogether. Most of the best places to visit are a little off the beaten path. There aren’t always buses to ancient stone circles or epic west coast fortresses like Castle Sween.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is to drive on the left-hand side and re-fuel whenever you can. Don’t expect to find a petrol station in every remote town or village and phone signal can be very unreliable in the Highlands.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Hiking-a-Munro.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking a Munro\" height=\"663\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Hiking a Munro.&nbsp;Photo by Graeme Johncock</p><h2><strong>THE GREAT OUTDOORS</strong></h2><p>Scotland is famous for its scenery and the best way to experience that isn’t from the road. Whether it’s a beach walk, woodland stroll or hiking in the hills, visiting Scotland is about exploring the great outdoors. The best part about it is that the trespass laws you might be used to don’t apply here.</p><p>Scotland has a “Right to roam” which means that in general, the public can walk where they want within reason. It doesn’t mean having a picnic in somebody’s back garden or trampling a farmer’s crops, but it does allow hikers to walk across hills, through glens and across rivers.</p><p>It comes in very handy when trying to tick off one of the 282 mountains above 3000 feet known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/loch-lomond-l2593/loch-lomond-1-hour-cruise-t152913/?partner_id=G1S2ECT&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher&amp;placement=content-middle&amp;cmp=cruise-gaelic&amp;deeplink_id=b8d0fe54-c7aa-5eca-a9e5-b2769ebb52d4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>Munros</em></strong></a>.</p><p>The right to roam also covers what is known as “wild camping”. As long as it is away from roads, buildings and historical monuments, anybody can pitch a small tent for the night. One of the best ways to wake up is high on a hillside, surrounded by nature without another soul for miles.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Huntly-Castle.jpg\" alt=\"Huntly Castle\" height=\"636\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Huntly Castle.

Every time of year has its pros and cons, it all depends on how you want to travel.</p><p>There is a much better chance of sun in the summer months although you can never be guaranteed it won’t rain. Expect the popular tourist areas to be very busy though and the outdoors to be full of little biting bugs called midges.</p><p>In winter, fortunately, those midges can’t handle the cold and neither can many tourists so everywhere is much quieter. The downside is that many attractions, restaurants and accommodations close down until spring.</p><p><br></p><p>That doesn’t mean there aren’t things to see though. Lots of ruined&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/eilean-donan-castle-l36443/isle-of-skye-and-eilean-donan-castle-tour-from-inverness-t190023/?partner_id=G1S2ECT&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher&amp;placement=content-middle&amp;cmp=castles-gaelic&amp;deeplink_id=82fc725f-5f38-5d88-8071-0b20c3e3aecd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>Scottish castles</em></strong></a>, coastal caves and Neolithic monuments are open and free to visit at any time, so off-season it’s likely you will have them to yourself.</p><p>To get the best of both worlds, try visiting towards the end of October or the start of April. Make sure to double-check Scottish school holidays to avoid that two-week rush.

And lastly, once you have completed your visit, click a selfie on the famous Rocky steps.&nbsp;</p><p>The renovations done by star architect Frank Gehry which was opened to the public last year, has transformed the gargantuan interiors, bringing in lots more public space and improving accessibility while preserving the original iconic architecture.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/In-front-of-the-beautiful-Rodin-Museum.jpg\" alt=\"In front of the beautiful Rodin Museum\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>In front of the beautiful Rodin Museum.

Some unusual choices – buttermilk cheddar, banana crunch and toffee touchdown.</p><p>The sfogliatelle pastry with its numerous crispy and flaky buttery layers and filled with ricotta cheese and candied lemon as noted on the card at the Termini Brothers bakery stall looked enticing.&nbsp;</p><p>If on the other hand you plan to buy the raw materials to whip up a delectable meal, you can do so too. Though of course I could not buy any as we were staying in a hotel, I loved my walk amongst the aisles of fresh produce capped by a stop at the stalls of fish and seafood.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/amish.jpg\" alt=\"Amish countryside\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Amish countryside</p><h2><strong>EXPLORING THE AMISH COUNTRYSIDE&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Trade in the cityscape and the highways for the bucolic landscape of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.discoverlancaster.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Pennsylvania Dutch Country</strong></a>, just about an hour’s drive away from Philadelphia.</p><p>We headed to Lancaster County, which is home to the Pennsylvania Amish, and is one of the oldest and largest such settlements in the country.

(29, 'HOW TO DO A TEMPLE STAY IN SOUTH KOREA', '<p>Have you ever tried living like a Buddhist monk for a day? That’s probably not a thought that would cross your mind.</p><p>In South Korea, it’s easy to get intrigued by the beauty of temple architecture and the serene landscape surrounding it.</p><p>There are around 900 traditional Buddhist temples throughout the country. Joygesa is a masterpiece smack dab in the middle of Seoul to Yonggunsa, which sits on a cliff overlooking the mountains. No matter which temple you go to, big or small, you’ll always be in awe of ancient history.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/temple.jpg\" alt=\"Jikjisa Temple\" height=\"532\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Jikjisa Temple. Photo by Michaela Cricchio</p><p>The price depends on the package you choose. For the experiential stay, you are looking to pay 80,000KRW ($65) for the program. It includes accommodations, food, and activities. For the free stay, it’s around 60,000KRW ($55).</p><p>When you reach the payment screen, I suggest you pay in cash because sometimes it won’t take a card. After your booking is complete, you will get a confirmation email. Keep the confirmation as booking proof.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/temple-statue.jpg\" alt=\"Jikjisa Temple statue\" height=\"548\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Jikjisa Temple statue. Photo by Michaela Cricchio</p><h2><strong>STAYING AT JIKJISA TEMPLE IN SOUTH KOREA</strong></h2><p>There are hundreds of options for a temple stay in South Korea. However, this will be about Jikjisa Temple in Gimcheon.</p><p>Let me start by saying that you need to be pretty open-minded to do something like this, especially when you’re staying at a sacred site.</p><p>The whole program is in Korean, but there should be a foreign tour guide that will help you with everything at the temple. They also translate what the monks say about Buddhism and the rituals.</p><h2><strong>THE ACTIVITIES&nbsp;IN SOUTH KOREA</strong></h2><p>When you arrive and check in at the temple, a guide will give you a briefing about the temple rules, such as mealtime, bedtime, and uniforms. You will also get to see your accommodation, a traditional&nbsp;<em>hanok</em>.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/temple-south-korea.jpg\" alt=\"Temple architecture\" height=\"642\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Temple architecture. Photo by Michaela Cricchio</p><h2><strong>A TEMPLE HISTORY LESSON</strong></h2><p>The first activity for the program was a tour of the temple. The guide explained the symbolism behind the intricately painted temples.</p><p>Many of the murals depict people being punished for deadly sins like stealing, adultery, and so on. You will also get to learn the history of the temple.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>THE MONK DIET&nbsp;IN SOUTH KOREA</strong></h2><p>The diet of a Buddhist monk is very healthy. They eat vegetarian and lactose-free foods. Especially in Korea, you can expect these meals to include rice, kimchi, other vegetable side dishes, and soup. Be on time for dinner because the food runs out quickly.</p><p>Another pro-tip for dinner is to finish every bit of your soup. You will use your soup bowl for drinking water.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/temple-kids.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Temple\" height=\"561\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Inside the Temple. Photo by Michaela Cricchio</p><h2><strong>108 PROSTRATIONS</strong></h2><p>This is a bowing practice done by monks before they meditate or teach. The purpose of this bowing is to take away from the wandering mind and snap you back into the present.&nbsp;</p><p>Buddhist believe that there are 108 compartments in the mind. These compartments can lead to thoughts like desire, anger, laziness, and whatever else you might think of.</p><p>The point of doing 108 bows is to touch every part of the mind and revert it to the present thoughts. More importantly, it’s a way to humble oneself.&nbsp;</p><p>The chanting during the prayer was in Korean. If you don’t speak Korea, no problem, it’s easy to follow what everyone else does. What’s important here is to be mindful of your surroundings and the silence that wraps around you like a blanket.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>108 AFFIRMATIONS</strong></h2><p>So, to help you count the 108 prostrations, you use prayer beads. This activity wasn’t just about physically threading the beads.</p><p>Each bead symbolized 108 affirmations. For every number, you thread a bead, and then take a bow until you have 108 beads in total.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/temple-food.jpg\" alt=\"Monk Tea Ceremony\" height=\"653\" width=\"500\"></p><p>Monk Tea Ceremony. Photo by Michaela Cricchio</p><h2><strong>MEDITATION WALK FOR CLARITY</strong></h2><p>After breakfast, the participants can enjoy a serene and scenic walking trail to the top of the mountain. It offers a breathtaking view of the valley landscape below from a pagoda.</p><p>This was about focusing on how we are walking and decluttering the mind. Taking a walk through the crisp, foggy mountain air at 4 am is more clarity than you can ask for.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>TEA CEREMONY WITH A MONK&nbsp;IN SOUTH KOREA</strong></h2><p>Enjoy East Asia’s more minimalized version of afternoon tea, called&nbsp;<em>Dado</em>. You sit on a pillow with a tray that includes teacups and a plate of nuts and berries. The monk will prepare the earthy-tasting tea blend, and you will serve it yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>During this time, the monk gave a background on Buddhism as a religion. Then, he went into depth on his life story and what exactly brought him to a life of solitude at a temple in the mountains. He’ll also answer questions or curiosities you have about temple life.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/temple-korea.jpg\" alt=\"A moment of reflection\" height=\"657\" width=\"500\"></p><p>A moment of reflection. Photo by Michaela Cricchio</p><h2><strong>REFLECTING ON THE 48 HOURS OF MONK LIFE</strong></h2><p>The experiential program is almost like living in another universe. For the rest of the world, it’s constantly a rise and grind, fast-paced culture, especially in South Korea. You live in a&nbsp;<em>pali-pali&nbsp;</em>culture<em>&nbsp;</em>(Korean for “hurry”).</p><p>At the temple, there were a few moments of enlightenment. The first was during the 108 prostrations. You’re around people who don’t speak the same language and were raised in a completely different culture. Yet, everyone comes together and practices sacred rituals.</p><p>The second moment was during the tea ceremony. All participants sat silently on pillows as the tea was poured from the kettle. You could hear the sea of insects singing a tune from the open windows. The trees sway outside, allowing a gentle breeze to flow inside. It was a moment of unexplainable peace.</p><p>There was something so precious about being away from the noise of everyday life. Something as simple as watching the sunrise through the trees. We live in a world where being fast and productive is always rewarded. Those monks just decided that it wasn’t for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Achieving that sense of calm takes a lot of practice, and the great thing is that you learn how to keep that balance. The monks touch on topics of meditation, which I know isn’t for everyone, but it’s worth giving it a shot.&nbsp;</p><p>Traveling is putting yourself in someone else’s shoes. It’s about experiencing how other people live, what they eat, and their values. It’s surreal doing the Buddhist rituals. You sit there and think to yourself, “How did I end up here?”</p><p>It is incredible being welcomed into a sacred space with zero background knowledge.

Bragging rights go to those who hike the leisurely two-hour ramble to the top.&nbsp;</p><p>While the reef surrounding Guam is a favorite for water sports of all types, it also has some of the best hiking trails.

Emerging from their bamboo and mud houses with tin roofs, people gathered around us.</p><p>Plastic chairs, a small table and a pitcher of water and glasses appeared. My guide, Zia Islam, of Tours &amp; Trips Bangladesh, was answering in Bengali the many questions about who I was and why I was there. Then tea and biscuits arrived, and we talked and laughed. It was like coming home.</p><p>“We don’t have a Taj Mahal or much tourism infrastructure, our attraction is our people,” Zia explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Disembarking-at-Tiger-Point-in-the-Sundarbans.-Photo-by-Edward-Placidi.jpg\" alt=\"Disembarking at Tiger Point in the Sundarbans.

Where are you from? Are you married? How many children do you have? What is your profession?”</p><p>They were curious as to why I was there in their village but seemed unsure about the concept of “I’m just a tourist.”</p><p>“They offer genuine hospitality,” said Zia. “They want nothing from you. You have come to their village and they want you to feel welcome. So they offer a chair, water, then tea and something to eat. It hurts them if you don’t take it.”</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Man-with-an-orange-beard-happily-standing-for-a-portrait-in-town-of-Rajshahi.-Photo-by-Edward-Placidi.jpg\" alt=\"Man with an orange beard happily standing for a portrait in town of Rajshahi.

When I told the park guide, Eusuf, that seeing the gibbons would be spectacular, it became his mission.</p><p>His ears perked as we hiked, listening for a call he knew well of hoolock gibbon families communicating with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly he froze, straining to hear, then we were running breakneck through the forest, tracking them, up hills, across streams, through dense foliage, stopping periodically to listen and gauge the direction.</p><p>Some 30 minutes later Eusuf collapsed, said he couldn’t go on, and besides we were losing them, the calls becoming fainter and more distant.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/banglasdesh.jpg\" alt=\"Farmer in Bangladesh\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Farmer in Bangladesh</p><p>But in the end, it was rewardingly ironic. Driving out of the park on the exit road, Eusuf suddenly slammed on the brakes, and we were again running through the forest.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there they were, above us, two families ‒ golden brown females and darker males and youngsters ‒ moving through the canopy with acrobatic grace, swinging agilely from branch to branch, an unforgettable moment of the trip.&nbsp;</p><p>Eusuf was beaming with pride at having found gibbons for me. Deep in the forest, they evaded us, only to show themselves by the road at the park’s edge.</p><p>On a day of sailing the maze of rivers, creeks and canals dissecting Banaripara region in southern Bangladesh ‒ visiting floating markets of vegetables and rice and the country’s largest timber market at astonishing Nesarabad, where a sea of hard-wood logs is strewn along the muddy banks of the Sandhya River ‒ we stopped at the Hindu village of Kuriana.</p><p>A simple greeting of “no-mohsh-kar” was all it took:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The tea shop lady mixed us up one her popular concoctions with herbs and spices, chatting us up endlessly.</p><p>The schoolteacher exuberantly invited us to come meet his class. Several Hindu women brought out chairs, ran for their mobile phones and we all posed for photos – then they showed their humble homes and the flower seeds they were planting for a Hindu festival.&nbsp;</p><p>A woman implored us to come to her house and sample her coconuts.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/At-Nesarabads-timber-market-a-sea-of-hard-wood-logs-is-strewn-along-the-muddy-river-banks.-Photo-by-Edward-Placidi.jpg\" alt=\"At Nesarabad’s timber market, a sea of hard-wood logs is strewn along the muddy river banks.

Zerin ‒ with just me and 25 Bengalis aboard ‒ we penetrated deep into the Sundarbans.&nbsp;</p><p>It was all smiles and making new friends as we plied the complex nexus of waterways penetrating the world’s largest mangrove forest that meets the planet’s most extensive tidal basin in the Bay of Bengal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Exploring by small boat and on hikes in dry areas among the mucky mangrove swamps, we saw many spotted deer, but otherwise, it was all fleeting glimpses:&nbsp;a six-foot water monitor lizard suddenly sliding off a slippery bank into the water; the back of a dolphin emerging and then immediately disappearing; a Crested Serpent Eagle swooping away; a terrapin turtle pushing his face out of the water for a quick view before submerging; a spectacular Greater Racquet-Tailed Drongo winging by and gone in an instant.</p><p>The great-animal-sighting hope here – to see a Bengal Tiger ‒ didn’t happen.</p><p>Aboard the ship, Simon took me under his wing, becoming my translator, guide and best friend, pensive Sium continually posed philosophical ideas to discuss, while many others sidled up sooner or later to test their limited English and make friends.</p><p>But in the end, it was all about Photo Day!&nbsp;Before docking on the last day, literally everyone ‒ individuals, couples and families ‒ asked to take a photo with me, the American on board, to remember the trip.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bangladesh-visit.jpg\" alt=\"Bandarban in Bangladesh\" height=\"543\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Bandarban in Bangladesh</p><p>Bangladeshis love taking people’s photos.

This megastructure, known as a henge, had a large entrance on the northeast with a smaller entry point to the south.&nbsp;</p><p>Inside the henge, 56 pits were found, each three feet in diameter.

The sky was a shiny blue, dotted with clouds, the weather bitterly cold – in fact, it was the perfect kind of weather to visit a sacred ground such as this.&nbsp;</p><p>I found out later that the birds use the nooks and crannies in the stones as their nesting ground and I was delighted to see one perched on top of a massive stone creating a picture-perfect scene.&nbsp;</p><p><em>See all you can in a short time on the Stonehenge express tour&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/london-l57/stonehenge-express-sightseeing-tour-t619/?partner_id=G1S2ECT&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher&amp;placement=content-middle&amp;cmp=stonhenge-express&amp;deeplink_id=3f56e7da-2fa4-5ca0-8438-261c554a889f\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/A-view-of-Roman-era-interiors-of-the-Roman-Baths.-Photo-by-Susmita-Sengupta-edited.jpg\" alt=\"A view of Roman era interiors of the Roman Baths.

I could walk right up to the roped-off hallowed stones and let my imagination flow.&nbsp;</p><p>I have to say, though I had seen enough pictures and even videos of Stonehenge earlier, seeing them in person is a sublime experience. Because really, it boggles the mind to think how the entire structure was established.&nbsp;</p><p>The audio guide I was listening to told me that the stone circle is an alignment of stones for the movement of the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of Stonehenge’s relationship with the solar and lunar calendar was first considered by scholars in the 18th century because they saw that during the midsummer solstice the sunrise was exactly framed by the end of the horseshoe of stones at the monument’s interior, and the midwinter sunset was framed at exactly the opposite point which was the center of the bend of the horseshoe.</p><p><br></p><p>It is truly an engineering feat that makes the sun’s rays flood the inner circle with sunlight on the summer and winter solstice, the longest and shortest days of the year, composing a corridor of sunshine.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the stones that emulated a doorway were most fascinating, I was intrigued by the singular upright stones: the smaller bluestones in the inner ring and the behemoth sarsens that resembled giant menhirs but with flat tops.&nbsp;</p><p>What was their purpose? Why were they not attached with a lintel stone? I don’t think anyone will ever find out the real answers.&nbsp;Stonehenge will continue to be a mystery.</p><p>I know that visiting oft-touristed sites is sometimes looked down upon, Stonehenge after all is inundated by close to a million visitors a year, but there’s no denying that seeing these mighty, man-made stone formations, one of the most famous prehistoric monuments, was exhilarating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Experience Stonehenge to the fullest on this best-selling full-day tour&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/london-l57/from-london-full-day-windsor-stonehenge-oxford-tour-t71373/?partner_id=G1S2ECT&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher&amp;placement=content-middle&amp;cmp=stonhenge-full&amp;deeplink_id=27fd4cec-c29f-59fb-83ca-407c26b2c3ca\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/A-street-in-Bath.-Photo-by-Susmita-Sengupta-edited.jpg\" alt=\"A street in Bath.

I headed there to get directions to my hotel as well as other attractions in Ystad.</p><p>A strong and enticing smell of coffee wafted across the square from the right. I turned in that direction and spotted Wallander’s favourite coffee shop, Fridolfs Konditori. A must-visit spot for later. But first I had to get my bearings.</p><p>With a population of some 19,000, Ystad is big enough to provide for a diversity of interests but small enough to allow for a slower pace of life.&nbsp;</p><p>Armed with a map and brochure from the tourist office I headed towards my hotel, just a two-minute walk from the train station. After checking in at the charming, old-world Hotel Intercontinental, I set out to explore the town.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ystad-Timber-framed-house.jpg\" alt=\"Ystad Timber framed house\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Timber-framed building in Ystad</p><h2><strong>SELF-GUIDED TOUR OF YSTAD</strong></h2><p>I had read about the Wallander guided tours and I wanted to take one Unfortunately, I found they didn’t start until July. However, the tourist office gave me a map with all of the locations featured in the TV series marked on it so that you can design your own walking tour.</p><p>Which I did. Turning right from the hotel onto Hamngatan I walked up to Stortorget, the town square.</p><p>Here I saw see several locations featured in the TV series such as restaurants Store Thor and Upp Eller Ner. Also, the old town hall facade, Gamla Rådhuset, that became a bank in one episode.</p><p>Plus, the bookshop where Wallander is supposedly a loyal customer.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/COLORFUL-YSTAD-SWEDEN.jpg\" alt=\"Ystad, Sweden is a charming town with Danish influence that also attracts fans of the Swedish TV series of fictional detective Kurt Wallander. #sweden \" height=\"750\" width=\"500\"></p><p>From Stortorget I walked along Stora Östergatan, Ystad’s busiest retail street packed with shops, cafes and restaurants. At the end I crossed over to Regementsgatan, spotting along the way Pilgrändhuset, Österportstorg and the Kings Head Pub &amp; Restaurant.</p><p>These are all places featured in various episodes. Finally, I reached the building at Mariagatan which doubled as Wallander’s apartment.</p><p>In the opposite direction, a walk along Sjömansgatan overlooking the harbour brought me to the Ystad Theatre. This is where a car bomb explodes in the episode entitled&nbsp;<em>The Cellist</em>.

Even if you don’t follow the TV series, Ystad has many attractions in addition to the landmarks just mentioned. It is also unlike most of the rest of Sweden in terms of its architecture.</p><p>This is because, in its early years, it belonged to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/experiencing-copenhagen-denmark/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Denmark</strong></a>&nbsp;along with the rest of Skåne, the province in which it’s located. In 1658 the Treaty of Roskilde ended centuries of Danish rule and Skåne was ceded to Sweden.</p><p><br></p><p>The early Danish influence has produced a charming and colourful town full of delightful half-timbered houses. There are literally hundreds of these striking buildings dating back to at least the 15th&nbsp;century.</p><p>Everywhere you look you can see this reminder of medieval times. Yet the streets also buzz with contemporary shops, cafés, bars and restaurants. Many of them are incorporated into the old buildings, along with museums and art galleries. The result is a charming small town that is a pleasure to wander around.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ystad-Swedish-Cardamom-buns.jpg\" alt=\"Ystad Swedish Cardamom buns\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Swedish Cardamom buns</p><h2><strong>EATING AND DRINKING IN YSTAD</strong></h2><p>After a day of such wandering, you will likely have worked up a healthy appetite.

The less frequent direct service takes little more than an hour.</p><p>If you want to use Ystad as a jumping-off point for other parts of the Baltic region, there are regular ferry services to the Danish island of Bornholm and to Świnoujście in Poland.</p><p>I went back to St Knuts torg before I left Ystad and had that coffee in Fridolfs Konditori.

Photo by Janine Avery</p><p>The Winelands cover a large area of South Africa’s Western Cape, encompassing some of the country’s most famous wine regions.</p><p>Some of the most popular regions for visitors to the Cape Winelands include Paarl, Tulbagh, Franschhoek and of course, Stellenbosch where you’ll find Muratie. But this is no ordinary Stellenbosch wine farm.</p><p>Yes, Muratie makes some great wines, and yes it has an amazing restaurant that serves farm-fresh cuisine for breakfast and lunch. But what really sets Muratie apart from other wine farms is the fact that it is still pretty much the same as it was in the late 1600s.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Art-is-found-all-over-the-farm-harking-back-to-the-estates-heritage-and-former-owner.-Photo-by-Janine-Avery.jpg\" alt=\"Art is found all over the farm, harking back to the estate\'s heritage and former owner.

Photo by Janine Avery</p><h2><strong>STEP BACK IN TIME AT MURATIE</strong></h2><p>The estate is owned and run by the Melck family who has been farming this land for most of its wine-making days. When arriving at Muratie you are almost immediately sent back in time thanks to the historic farming equipment and tools on display at the entrance to the wine cellar and tasting room.</p><p>Once inside the cellar, you will have entered a time capsule with original paintings and furniture that has been collected over many years.&nbsp;Any Stellenbosch visitor will be able to regale you with tales of Oom Samie Se Winkel. A local institution, and a must-do stop in the Cape Winelands.</p><p>Reminiscent of the rural trading posts of the Victorian era, the store is packed floor to ceiling with knick-knacks, artworks, antiques, and relics of a bygone era. And when stepping foot inside Muratie it’s easy to see that this estate is owned by the same family of collectors!</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-GP-Canitz-cottage-at-Muratie.-Photo-by-Janine-Avery.jpg\" alt=\"The GP Canitz cottage at Muratie.

Photo by Janine Avery</p><h2><strong>TASTING WITH A DIFFERENCE</strong></h2><p>The tasting room is also something special with its cobwebs that decorate the walls and wrap themselves around the vintage wine bottles and paintings on display.</p><p>The owners of the farm have converted some of the old concrete fermentation tanks into little sitting areas where you can still feel the wax coating on the walls. However, just next door more of these ancient concrete fermentation tanks still hold some of the estate’s recent vintages.</p><p>The tasting experience will also introduce you to some of the characters from the farm’s past with each wine varietal named after one of the people who share Muratie’s rich history.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-sunny-terrace-at-Muratie-is-the-ideal-space-to-enjoy-some-farm-fresh-cuisine.-Photo-by-Janine-Avery.jpg\" alt=\"The sunny terrace at Muratie is the ideal space to enjoy some farm-fresh cuisine.

Photo by Janine Avery</p><h2><strong>YOU’LL NEVER WANT TO LEAVE</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve arrived at Muratie, the estate’s welcoming atmosphere will ensure you never want to leave and thankfully we didn’t have to just yet as my family and I had the pleasure of spending an amazing night on the farm.&nbsp;</p><p>Muratie has only one offering for accommodation which is the GP Canitz Guest Cottage, sleeping two adults. The cottage is well equipped with one large bedroom with an en-suite bathroom, a small kitchen, and a beautiful living room with a large fireplace.</p><p>It is situated close to the restaurant and within a few steps from the tasting room and art gallery.&nbsp;</p><p>Now if you had ever dreamed of owning a wine farm this is just the place for you. Once the farmworkers have gone home and the restaurant and tasting room have closed, Muratie is completely yours – well apart from the actual owner of course, who lives in the farm’s historical manor house.&nbsp;</p><p>Once we had done some exploring and taken a stroll through the vineyards, we decided to take our bottle of MCC and sit on the grass and simply take in our surroundings as the sun slowly slipped behind the mountains.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-wine-tasting-rooms-are-located-within-old-fermentation-tanks.-Photo-by-Janine-Avery.jpg\" alt=\"The wine tasting rooms are located within old fermentation tanks.

Photo by Janine Avery</p><h2><strong>SO MUCH MORE TO ENJOY</strong></h2><p>But, as mentioned, there is so much more to Muratie than just good food and wine. The estate is also a haven for lovers of the outdoors with amazing hiking trails as well mountain biking. There is even a trail center on site which caters to all your needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Harking back to Muratie’s art history, with one of the farm’s previous owners GP Canitz (for which the cottage is named) being a famous artist, there is also an art gallery on the property. Here modern artworks sit juxtaposed against the bare brick walls of the very first dwelling on the estate.</p><p>There’s bound to be something everyone can enjoy at this rustic, off-the-beaten-track, wine estate in the Cape. Whether you are visiting for the day or wanting to plan a romantic weekend away, you should definitely add Muratie to your bucket list.</p>', 4, 5, '2023-05-31 13:31:42', 'economy', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Cobwebs-possibly-some-from-the-1600s-still-line-the-walls-Photo-by-Janine-Avery.jpg'),

(36, 'THE BEST ALTERNATIVE DESTINATIONS TO EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES', '<p>There are so many amazing capital cities in the world. Each capital reflects the culture of the country, and no two capitals are the same. Often, a country’s capital is the most visited city in the country and can attract many visitors.</p><p>Capital cities are often also the most well-known, with many being simply iconic. However, when we step away from the likes of Paris, Amsterdam and Rome, which each are spectacular cities in their own right, it is possible to see that there are fantastic cities and regions overlooked in favour of capitals.</p><p>Here are some picks for the best alternatives to capital cities in Europe:</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Strasbourg-France.-Photo-by-Georges-Christophe.jpg\" alt=\"Strasbourg, France.

ALSACE REGION, FRANCE&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I would absolutely recommend visiting France’s iconic capital at least once. I have had my own romantic getaway to Paris and would recommend it to anyone, taking a romantic partner or not.</p><p>It is so jam-packed with amazing sights and things to do that you could go with a partner, friends, family, or simply go alone. When discussing going to France, Paris is likely the first destination that pops into mind.</p><p>I have been to France countless times to different areas of the country, with several friends living there, and can contend that there is so much more to see outside of Paris.</p><p><br></p><p>My personal favourite is the Alsace Region, a Germanic region of France that looks like it could have been pulled straight out of a fairytale.</p><p>The brightly painted buildings combined with the peaceful atmosphere of towns in this region makes it perfect to visit if you are looking for something a bit quieter than Paris.</p><p>I first visited the region in 2019 on a small trip around various places in North-Western Europe and absolutely fell in love with it.</p><p>The locals are insanely welcoming, the scenery looks like something out of a movie, and it really should be a crime to leave without trying the out-of-this-world chocolate in this region of France.</p><p>If you plan to visit and do not have long to do it, my top picks would be Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse. There really is something to see everywhere you turn when visiting and your days there will never be boring.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Gothenburg-Sweden.-Photo-by-Anna.jpg\" alt=\"Gothenburg, Sweden.

GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN&nbsp;AS AN ALTERNATIVE CITY</strong></h2><p>I visited both Stockholm and Gothenburg on a road trip around Scandinavia the summer before starting university. The home of ABBA, Stockholm is one of those destinations I had been so desperate to visit for many years.</p><p>My fascination with Sweden in general probably came from my obsession with Zara Larsson when she competed in and won the 2008 series of&nbsp;<em>Talang&nbsp;</em>(the Swedish version of the Got Talent franchise).</p><p>Admittedly, I had never heard of Gothenburg before this trip was planned and went there not knowing much at all about it. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect, but what I found was a never-ending scope of simply outstanding views.</p><p>This was not any typical boring city; the streets are lined with the most amazing colours, locals entertain with their instruments, and the best meatballs I’ve ever tasted can be found here.</p><p>Visitors can panoramically appreciate the entirety of the city by venturing to Skansen Kronan, to look over the city and take in the beauty of what locals are living in amongst.</p><p>Gothenburg also has a variety of canals that visitors can use if they wish to explore the city by boat. Visiting the city on a sunny day is sure to give travellers an unforgettable visual experience, with a bright and bustling atmosphere at every turn.</p><p>While Stockholm exceeded my expectations, I really had no expectations at all for Gothenburg, however the unexpected can often lead to the best experiences.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Brno-Czechia.-Photo-by-Ignat-Arapov.jpg\" alt=\"Brno, Czechia.

BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC&nbsp;AS AN ALTERNATIVE CITY</strong></h2><p>It goes without saying that Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is my absolute favourite travel destination. I have been twice, once for my 18th birthday and also in Summer 2020 when leisure travel started to resume.</p><p>I am absolutely in love with Prague as I feel it really has everything; a wide variety of history, unique side streets, amazing nightlife, the best walking tours I have been on, and more.</p><p>I believe the city is absolutely faultless and I cannot recommend it enough, Prague is always the first destination I suggest when someone asks me for travel recommendations. However, the Czech Republic is full of smaller destinations catering to tourists, one of which being Brno.</p><p>Another destination I didn’t know of until a couple of years ago, Brno is close to major cities such as Vienna and Prague, making it a viable option for a day trip when looking for something outside of capital cities.</p><p><br></p><p>The city is full of outstanding architecture, and in comparison to Czechia’s famous capital, is extremely peaceful and perfect for someone wishing to venture to a destination to relax a little.</p><p>Brno is a charming destination that could leave a visitor wandering and roaming the streets for hours on end, with so much to see.</p><p>For those who love nature and consider themselves nature tourists, the surrounding areas of Brno are perfect for walking and taking in the countryside air.&nbsp;Travel does not always have to involve popular, well-known destinations.</p><p>There is a whole world outside of the typical choices of travel, and while these capital cities should be visited at least once, it is important to remember just how much is on offer outside of these capitals at alternative cities.</p>', 4, 5, '2023-05-31 13:33:45', 'economy', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Strasbourg-France.-Photo-by-Georges-Christophe.jpg'),

A place where people are eager to share their culture, food, history and conversation.</p><p>You will be treated to Bedouin hospitality, which traditionally begins with dates and small cups of Arabic coffee in a three-sided tent. Then a communal meal is served where everyone is seated on the ground on colorful rugs and shares rice and pieces of mutton cooked on a spit.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-Hassan-Owner-of-Shop-27-in-the-Souq-in-Riyadh.-Hassan-fashions-jewelry-to-look-like-polished-diamonds-from-stones-picked-up-in-the-desert-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Saudi Arabia\" height=\"779\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Hassan, Owner of Shop #27 in the Souq in Riyadh.

Also, antique silver jewelry and hand-crafted gold necklaces, earrings and bracelets.</p><p>For sure, the merchants will “…offer you a special price for you today” for anything you would like to buy (though no bargaining the price of gold).</p><p>Chances are you will go home with a handmade carpet, the colors of which are far too beautiful to leave behind. Or maybe a gold necklace or earrings that will remind you of the merchant taking time to serve you sweet mint tea and talk about the design of the jewelry.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-Rijal-Alma-Museum-showcasing-the-architecture-of-the-SW-region-influenced-historially-by-Yemeni-architecture.-Photo-by-Ava-Kabouchy-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rijal Alma Museum showcasing the architecture of the SW region, influenced historially by Yemeni architecture\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Rijal Alma Museum showcasing the architecture of the SW region, influenced historically by Yemeni architecture.

It was part of his program called&nbsp;<em>Vision 2030</em>, meant to bring his country into the 21st&nbsp;century. Likely also realizing that the supply of oil is diminishing and that tourism could bring in needed revenue in the future.</p><p>Music of all kinds is now played in outdoor theaters and men and women, married or not, can enjoy it together. Singers and performers such as Mariah Carey and Sean Paul recently appeared on stage together.</p><p>The South Korean group, Super Junior also performed to the delight of young Saudi women, whose interest in Korea was piqued by this group. I remember a student of mine enthusiastically talking about Korean culture and food and had even taught herself some phrases from the language.</p><p>Some performers, however, such as Nicki Minaj, cancelled their shows to protest the Kingdom’s violation of women’s rights and those of the LGBTQ community.</p><p>The claim was that the Crown Prince was only allowing musical concerts to better the image of his country. Those claims may be true, but change continues to take place.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-The-author-on-a-camping-trip-in-Abqaiq.-Photo-by-Ava-Kabouchy-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Visiting Saudi Arabia\" height=\"426\" width=\"749\"></p><p>The author on a camping trip in Abqaiq.

Alcohol is still banned though there is some talk of its being allowed in hotels that foreigners frequent.</p><p>Movie theaters have opened and, maybe most importantly, since 2018 women have been allowed to drive, making work more accessible to them than it was previously.</p><p><br></p><p>Professions such as police officers and lawyers, once the domain of men only, are now open to women. They now make up about 52% of the student population in the universities.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, stoning was punishment for adultery, but that practice no longer exists. Plus flogging for what were known as ‘moral crimes’ rarely, if ever, happens.&nbsp;Religious tolerance is increasing and the Mutawa no longer roam the streets looking for violations of Sharia Law.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-King-Abdulaziz-Camel-Festival-Rumah.-Photo-by-Ava-Kabouchy-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, Rumah\" height=\"464\" width=\"750\"></p><p>King Abdulaziz Camel Festival, Rumah.

Each February outside Riyadh, a festival of Saudi Arabian culture and that of other Gulf countries is held. Here people are eager to talk with visitors about their country and will want to learn about theirs in return.</p><p>Twice I attended the festival and I was invited to sit with Saudi women, one of whom gave me a bottle of water from Makkah, Islam’s holiest city.&nbsp;Another gave me delicious cookies, ma’amoul, filled with dates, made in Qassim Province to the north of Riyadh.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-A-Potter-at-Work-in-his-Workshop-in-Qatief.-Photo-by-Ava-Kabouchy-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi Arabia potter\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\"></p><p>A Potter at Work in his Workshop in Qatief.

Also unlikely you’ve slept in a Bedouin tent under the stars of the Empty Quarter.</p><p>Or visited Abha, where the high mud houses were built upon mountainsides and reachable only by a rope, a way of keeping Ottoman warriors at bay.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-Scene-in-Old-Jeddah-the-Al-Balad-section.-Photo-by-Ava-Kabouchy-1-of-1.jpg\" alt=\"Saudi Arabia Scene in Old Jeddah, the Al Balad section\" height=\"500\" width=\"750\"></p><p>Scene in Old Jeddah, the Al Balad section.

Nor gone diving or snorkeling in the Red Sea. But all this and more are there for the taking.</p><p>I still miss the Kingdom, its hospitality, its culture, its warm, sandy deserts.

Photo by Ava Kabouchy</p><h2><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS ON VISITING SAUDI ARABIA TODAY</strong></h2><p>When I made the decision to accept a teaching position in Saudi Arabia, friends asked if I wasn’t afraid to go there.&nbsp;Others since that time have expressed to me that that is a country they would never visit mostly because of the country’s human rights abuses, including the way women are treated, the death of a dissenting Saudi journalist, and the overall perception that the Middle East is a dangerous place.</p><p>What I found instead was a country opening up to the 21st&nbsp;century, where many of the restrictions have disappeared. Never did I feel afraid even when I traveled solo; in fact, I&nbsp;felt welcomed wherever I went.</p><p><br></p><p>A frequent question I am asked about my time in the Kingdom is whether I had to wear an abaya and cover my hair, and the answer is “Yes.”&nbsp;At the time, all women had to wear an abaya and put a scarf to cover their hair, but a niqab, the face-covering required of Saudi women was not necessary for foreigners.&nbsp;</p><p>All that has since changed.&nbsp;Foreign women can now go out without an abaya, but are asked to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goworldtravel.com/how-to-dress-traveling-in-muslim-countries/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 149, 223); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>dress modestly&nbsp;</strong></a>– no tank tops, shorts, or tight pants.&nbsp;</p>', 8, 5, '2023-05-31 13:34:54', 'local', 1, 1, 0, 'https://www.goworldtravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Saudi-Arabia-Children-in-Mithnab-one-of-Saudi-Arabias-Heritage-Villages-in-Qassim-Province-north-of-Riyadh.-Photo-by-Ava-Kabouchy-1-of-1.jpg');

The Gold Souk, Spice Souk, and Perfume Souk are all within walking distance, and the famed Textile Souk is just across the creek. While you’ll be able to bargain very low prices, you’ll likely find many goods emblazoned with the words “Made in China.” Thoroughly inspect all items before settling on a price.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Souk Madinat Jumeirah was constructed to resemble a traditional Arabic market. While you’ll score stunning photos here, you’ll also pay for those pictures with higher prices at all of the stalls. The goods at this market are more likely to be handmade, but still inspect everything carefully and haggle to get the best price (try for half of the vendor\'s opening offer). If you visit at night, you’ll enjoy a free concert, as live music fills the halls.</p><h2><strong>Visit Dubai on a stopover</strong></h2><p>If you don’t think you can afford a full vacation in Dubai, but still want to experience the Middle Eastern metropolis, tack it onto another trip.

It hosts the impressive Sultan Qaboos Mosque, Muttrah Souq, and the Royal Opera House.</p><h3><strong>Sultan Qaboos Mosque</strong></h3><p>The Sultan Qaboos Mosque is Oman’s most important spiritual site. This architectural masterpiece opened in 2001. It’s required for both men and women to wear long sleeve tops and long pants to the ankle. For women, bring a scarf to cover your hair.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Muttrah Souq</strong></h3><p>Oman citizens are a big mix of Omani, Indian and African people. You can notice this at Muttrah souq where many shops are selling Omani and Indian items. But also everyday items you use in your kitchen.</p><p>Tip:&nbsp;Fridays and Saturdays are weekend days and some parts of the souq will be closed.</p><p><img src=\"../uploads/oman-route-guide-muscat-city.jpg\"></p><h3><strong>Lunch at Kargeen</strong></h3><p>The restaurant Kargeen is a small great hideout in the middle of the city.

It is almost guaranteed that you will see dolphins. A morning tour should cost OMR 17 (45 USD).</p><h2><strong>Day 3 – 4: Muscat to Sur</strong></h2><p>After those first two days, drive down the perfect route towards the coastline. This is an easy 90-minute drive, all highway.</p><p><br></p><p>Tip:&nbsp;Wear or take swim clothing on this day.</p><h3><strong>Bimmah Sinkhole</strong></h3><p>After a good 90 minutes of driving, you will reach Bimmah Sinkhole. This is probably one of the most incredible natural swimming pools you will ever see. The water is a beautiful turquoise color and one of the best cooldowns during the heat of the day. The story lives that a meteor created the hole.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Wadi Shab</strong></h3><p>Wadi Shab meaning gorge between the cliff is a must-visit! From Bimmah Sinkhole, drive about 20 minutes to reach the parking spot.</p><p>Make sure to buy some extra water and head to the river. Pay 1 OMR to cross the river, from there it’s a 45 min walk to the swimming point.

Take a refreshing dip and drive to your desert camp in the Wahiba Sands. Most of the camps can be reached by driving a 4×4 yourself but do ask your host, they might arrange a pick-up. If you are planning to drive yourself, deflate your tires a bit at one of the local shops.</p><p>Plan to stay two nights in the desert, explore the area by car or by foot, go stargazing, and experience living between the dunes</p><p><br></p><p>Find all:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://saltinourhair.com/go/desert-camps-oman/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Desert Camps to stay</a></p><h2><strong>Day 7 – 8: Nizwa</strong></h2><p>On day 7 you will drive the longest distance. Follow your journey to Birkat Al Mouz, one of the old villages surrounded by green banana plantations. Use around 1 hour to explore the ruins here. The drive from the desert takes about 2 hours.</p><h3><strong>Nizwa</strong></h3><p>From Birkat Al Mouz, drive to the historical town called Nizwa.

Infrastructure is very, very good and fuel is cheap. To follow this 10-day Oman route guide you will need a 4×4 in the desert and up in the mountains. Renting a 4×4 costs around $950 for 10 days.</p><p>Google Maps turn-by-turn navigation doesn’t work in Oman, but on iOS, there’s another app called ‘Here we go’ which works perfectly.</p><p><br></p><p>We recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saltinourhair.com/oman/rent-car-oman/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">renting a car in Oman</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.saltinourhair.com/go/sunnycars-en-oman/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sunny Cars</a>&nbsp;as they work with local car rental companies.

The temperature will be between 20 and 30 degrees. Summer temperatures go anywhere from 35 to 50 degrees.</p><p>If you’re planning to visit the mountains like Jabal Akhdar, you should plan a visit in summer when temperatures rise from 0 in winter to 30 in summer.</p><h2><strong>Food in Oman</strong></h2><p>The food in Oman is a mix of Arabian and Indian kitchens. You will mostly find delicious bread, curries, dates, and kebabs.</p><h2><strong>Oman Route Guide: Oman Visa</strong></h2><p>Getting a visa in Oman is super easy. E-visa can be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://saltinourhair.com/go/get-visa/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">requested online</a>. It will cost you around $45 per visa, depending on the country you are from. It takes anywhere from 2 days to 1 week to receive your visa via email.</p><h2><strong>What to wear in Oman</strong></h2><p>Oman is very modern and open in what you wear. They don’t give you a set of clothing rules once you enter the country. It is respectful to always cover up your upper body, shoulders, and wear shorts or skirts over your knees.</p><p>Again, Omani people are very modern and they will only really ask you to cover up when you are on a religious site.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Costs of traveling in Oman</strong></h2><p>Oman is not a budget travel country.

(42, 'KUWAIT TRAVEL GUIDE', '<p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Welcome to your travel guide to Kuwait! Are you planning a trip to one of the smallest desert countries in the Middle East? No worries, I’m here to help. Here you’ll find everything you need to know about getting to Kuwait, getting around, what to eat, where to stay, what to do, and how to speak some basic Arabic. You’ll be ready to go in no time with this Kuwait travel guide.</p><blockquote><em>A huge shout-out and thank you to my friend Abdullah for editing this post and being my tour guide around Kuwait City!</em></blockquote><h2>Getting to Kuwait</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Kuwait isn’t necessarily the cheapest place to get to, but you can definitely find some good deals.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wandercuse.com/flight-deals/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Check my flight tips to help you out</strong></a>! Remember, you’ll always save money flying out of a major city in the US, and to get to Kuwait you’ll likely connect in a nearby country (Dubai is a common layover).</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Once you get to Kuwait, you’ll need to wait in a very long line to get your Kuwait visitor’s visa. If you happen to have Kuwaiti dinar on you, you can use one of the kiosks to speed up the process. (I learned the hard way that everyone who uses the kiosks gets to skip ahead of those who don’t…)</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Airport.jpg?resize=450%2C338&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Airport\" height=\"338\" width=\"450\"></p><h2>Getting Around Kuwait</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I was lucky enough to be visiting with a former student and friend in Kuwait City, so when I wan’t being transported by the hotel shuttle, he drove me around town. Nevertheless, here are your options for getting around Kuwait:</p><h3>Walk</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Just like the climate in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wandercuse.com/uae-travel-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>UAE</strong></a>, Kuwait can be really, really, hot. So follow the same advice if you’re determined to walk – wear lightweight fabric and bring bottled water with you. But, unless you’re planning on staying right in the city center, things aren’t always easily walkable.</p><h3>Taxi</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Taxis are an expensive option, but also the most popular for getting around Kuwait. You’ll find two types of taxis: white and orange. White taxis are what you’d typically find – you hail them and your rate is based on your distance and time of day. It is Kuwaiti law for taxi drivers to abide by the meters, but you may have to encourage them to do so. If they are hesitant, ask for a pre-arranged price before departing. Orange taxis drive along pre-determined routes and passengers may share the ride with others traveling along the same route. (Orange taxi rates will be cheaper.)</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Female travelers who are alone are encouraged&nbsp;<strong>not<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>to hail taxis on their own. In addition, not all taxis have seatbelts, so be sure that yours does before entering.</p><h3>Uber</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Uber is not available in Kuwait, but you can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.careem.com/en-kw/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Careem</strong></a>. If you’re feeling more luxurious,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/qa/app/draewil-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%84-book-limo-ride/id1231362235\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Draewil</strong></a>&nbsp;offers limo rides!</p><h3>Public Transport</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Public transportation is not as readily available as I would like, so stick with cars. While there is an extensive public bus system, it does not always coincide with tourist destinations.</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Cultural-Centre.png?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre in Kuwait\" height=\"450\" width=\"600\"></p><h2>Speaking Arabic</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Yet again I was surprised at the amount of people who spoke English. While not as common as the UAE, I found English to be enough to get by.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Either way, here are some useful phrases to know in Arabic:</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">*When you see an apostrophe in the word, it sounds like a short pause. Also, these spellings are mostly phonetic, and are often different across different sources. Remember, Arabic uses a different writing system! Plus they read and write from right to left.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“merhaba” / “ahlan” – Hello</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“saba’a al-khayr” – Good Morning / Good Day</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“masaa’ al-khayr” – Good Afternoon / Good Evening</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“wada’an” – Goodbye</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“salam alaykum” – ‘Peace be upon you’ (A common greeting)</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“shukran” – Thank you</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“’afwan” – You’re welcome</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“min faDlik” – Please</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“na’am” – Yes</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“la’a” – No</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“arabiya” – Arabic (the language)</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“inglesi” – English</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“al’afw” – Excuse me</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“aasif” – Sorry</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“ismii…” – My name is…</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“kayfa haluk?” – How are you?</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“anta” (m) / “anti” (f) – You</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“ma’ay” – Water</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“qahua” – Coffee</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">“cha’y” – Tea</p><h2>Kuwaiti Dinar</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">The exchange rate as of this post, is roughly .3 dinar to one US dollar. So while things may same to be “cheap” in restaurants and stores, multiply the price by 3. And then some! Regardless, I still found Kuwait to be budget friendly for the most part. I never exchanged money in Kuwait, but was traveling with someone who had. The only problem I came across was not being able to get a cup of coffee from a little coffee cart, but I managed! That goes to say that it’s possible to get around with plastic only, but it’s always a good idea to have some dinar with you.</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Street-Art.jpg?resize=461%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Street Art\" height=\"600\" width=\"461\"></p><h2>Do’s and Don’ts in Public</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Since Kuwait is a predominantly muslim country, it’s wise to be as conservative as possible in your dress and behavior. Common practices include avoiding touch between members of the opposite sex (unless married to them). Homosexuality is illegal in Kuwait; so avoid overtly displaying your affections for people of the same gender.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">It’s also best to dress more conservatively. That’s not to say that you need to be completely covered, but for women it’s best to cover up to your shoulders and down to your knees.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">It is nearly (if not entirely) impossible to find alcohol in Kuwait, and it is illegal to be drunk in public. It’s best to avoid it completely and do not travel into Kuwait with alcohol. Also avoid bringing in any beef or pork products.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">During the month of Ramadan, non-muslims are also expected to follow the religious fasting from sunrise to sunset. That means no eating, drinking, or smoking.</p><h2>Kuwaiti Food</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">I discovered some of my new favorite foods in Kuwait! Everything was so delicious. If you learn nothing else from this Kuwait travel guide, learn this: try all the authentic Kuwaiti food. It’s amazing!</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">A few things to note when eating with others at Kuwaiti restaurants: It is very common for people to order several dishes for the table and share them (think tapas style). Kuwaiti people are also very hospitable, so if they offer to pay for your dinner or ask you to try something, oblige them. It’s also not unusual for people to eat with their hands. Lastly, and this one’s my favorite, Kuwaiti people will often take the leftovers from their meal and give it to someone on the street. It’s the most simple but thoughtful act of charity.</p><h3>Majboos</h3><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Majboos.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Majboos\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Quite possibly my favorite food from the region, and one of my favorites from anywhere. Majboos is the traditional dish of Kuwait. Often made with chicken or lamb, it’s made from basmati rice dish cooked in a seasoned broth and topped with meat. The meat is so tender and flavorful, you’ll find it hard to stop eating! Plus the added raisins add just a touch of sweetness to the dish.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br></p><h3>Jireesh</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Made from cracked wheat, this is a common Kuwaiti comfort food. Cooked in meat broth with spices and tomatoes, it has a mushy or soupy texture. Give it a try with some bread; it’s tasty!</p><h3>Kubbah</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Made from a potato like dough, kubbah is filled with ground meat, rolled into small balls, and fried. This is another dish that is very common in the region, with different countries taking different spins with the spices and flavors.</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-food.jpg?resize=600%2C454&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait food\" height=\"454\" width=\"600\"></p><h3>Warak Enab</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Stuffed grape leaves – one of my favorite Middle Eastern foods! I had to get some at the authentic Kuwaiti restaurant. When warak enab is fresh, you’ll find it full of fresh spices and covered in oil and lemon juice.</p><h3><strong>Luqaimat</strong></h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">This sweet dessert is common to most countries in the region (and is often found at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wandercuse.com/syracuses-big-fat-greek-festival/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Syracuse Greek</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wandercuse.com/a-month-of-festivals-syracuse-in-july/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Middle Eastern festivals</strong></a>!). It’s soft on the inside, slightly hard on the outside, and slathered in a honey-like coating. Yum!</p><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Dessert.jpg?resize=600%2C353&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Dessert\" height=\"353\" width=\"600\"></p><h2>Where to Stay in Kuwait</h2><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Kuwait is a small country, and Kuwait City is where you’ll want to be. Hotels are very moderately priced. It is very easy to find lots of options under $100 USD. Of course there are some more high-end options available if that’s your thing.</p><h2>What to See &amp; Do</h2><h3>Kuwait Towers</h3><p><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Travel-Guide-Kuwait-Towers.jpg?resize=351%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Travel Guide - Kuwait Towers\" height=\"450\" width=\"351\"></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Kuwait Towers look like they are straight out of&nbsp;<em>The Jetsons</em>. They are incredible! Super futuristic looking, but smack dab in the middle of the desert. I recommend taking the elevator up to the top and eating at the buffet with a huge spread of food. When you’re done eating, you can go up one more floor to the observation deck to get some beautiful views of Kuwait. Fun fact: the deck rotates, so you can stay in one spot and see the whole 360° view!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Towers-Observatory.jpg?ssl=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Towers-Observatory.jpg?resize=600%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Towers Observatory\" height=\"450\" width=\"600\"></strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Towers-Meal.jpg?ssl=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Towers-Meal.jpg?resize=600%2C439&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Towers Meal\" height=\"439\" width=\"600\"></strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Towers-Staircase.jpg?ssl=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Towers-Staircase.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Towers Staircase\" height=\"600\" width=\"450\"></strong></a></li></ul><h3>Souk Al-Gharabally</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">Just like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wandercuse.com/uae-travel-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(71, 1, 71); background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Gold Souk in Dubai</strong></a>, here is where you’ll find the most authentic Kuwaiti goods. I was able to get some beautiful scarves and traditional candies to bring back home as gifts – for just a few dinar each! Don’t be afraid to barter, it’s expected. Never pay full price – haggle!

It’s clearly designed to be a destination for people to visit.</p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">In the central parts of the mall you’ll find your typical shops like H&amp;M and high-end brands, plus globally-known restaurants and cafés like Cheesecake Factory and Starbucks. But, if you travel to the side hallways, it turns into more traditional architecture and is reminiscent of old Kuwait roads. That is where you’ll find more authentic Kuwaiti shops and restaurants.</p><ul><li><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Avenues-Mall.jpg?resize=600%2C447&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Avenues Mall\" height=\"447\" width=\"600\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wandercuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Kuwait-Avenues-Mall-Inside.jpg?resize=450%2C600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Kuwait Avenues Mall Inside\" height=\"600\" width=\"450\"></li></ul><h3>Sheikh Abdullah Al Salem Cultural Centre</h3><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">An impressive 22 galleries make up this cultural complex that has taken several years to design and build.

(46, '23 Amazingly Cheap Places You Should Travel To In 2023', '<p>If you’re looking for some affordable destinations to put on your travel list for 2023, then I’ve got some perfect suggestions for you.</p><p>Now, I should warn that a lot of lists of ‘cheapest countries’ out there are just plain wrong. For example, I’ve seen Costa Rica mentioned by a major outlet as the cheapest destination in the Americas — umm, have they actually&nbsp;<em>been</em>? Often these lists seem quite randomly chosen and not very accurate.</p><p>I thought I’d try to do a bit better by sticking to destinations&nbsp;<strong style=\"color: rgb(26, 37, 48);\">that I’ve personally been to</strong>. I’ve listed them not only because they’re good bargains, but because they’re safe and amazing destinations regardless of cost.</p><p>While inflation and increased airfares have affected travel, luckily many destinations that were always great bargains still are. If you are from a Western country then exchange rates with many emerging economies are actually highly favorable at the moment. (For example, South America is generally now way less expensive than it was pre-pandemic.)</p><p>Realizing just how far your Dollars, Euros, or Pounds can go in cheaper countries can be eye-opening. For the price of a single restaurant meal in, say, London or New York, you could be covering a whole day’s worth of traveling in cheap countries like Indonesia, Argentina, Vietnam, Mexico, or Turkey — to name just a few.</p><p>In many cheap travel destinations, it’s very doable to spend around $30 to $50 on all your travel expenses per person per day. I’ll be highlighting some of the best of them here.</p><h2>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<strong>THAILAND</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://www.indietraveller.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/railay_beach.jpg\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\"></p><p>Thailand is back!
